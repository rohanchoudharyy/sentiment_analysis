## Objective: 
Try to predict the sentiment (Positive (1) or negative (0)) behind a comment.
## Skill Path: 
Python, Machine Learning algorithms, Natural Language Processing.
## Abstract:
A dataset with course reviews was used in this task. It had course reviews of various courses present on coursera and their corresponding sentiment score (out of 5). The score was scaled from 0 to 1 and then several classification algorithms were tried. Various ML models were used to predict sentiments, the one with the highest accuracy was used in the end. Na√Øve Bayes algorithms gave the best accuracy (83%). Other algorithms were also used: Random Forest (78% accuracy), Decision Tree (78% accuracy) and Logistic Regression (80% accuracy).
