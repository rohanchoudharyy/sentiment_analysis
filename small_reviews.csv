5,"Great course - I recommend it for all, especially IT and Business Managers!",5
6,One of the most useful course on IT Management!,5
7,"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.",3
8,Super content. I'll definitely re-do the course,5
9,One of the excellent courses at Coursera for information technology bosses and managers.,5
10,"Is there any reason why you should not apply the course by BCG?)It's content is pretty unique and includes a high level analysis and a wide range of knowledge needed to cover all detailed aspects.Best regards,Oleg Serov",5
11,Excellent course and teachers. Congratulations!!,5
12,This is a good course for an CIO in a non technical company.,5
13,"Good content, but the course setting does (at least for me) not allow learn the content long term due to missing reading material.",3
14,Very structured approach. Thank you for sharing with me.,5
15,"Program demystifies the evolving world of CIOs in a typical global corporation.Coverage being introductory familiarizes participants nicely through some of the nuances & emerging trends.When I took the course participant numbers was fewer, so feedback was quite delayed. So one should plan to be patient to get their peer reviews.Based on peer reviews i sensed much variations in their expectations.Few sections are in French with Subtitles.Subtitle quality requires audit/review.",4
16,Very relevant and useful course designed for CIOs,5
17,This course does not say anything about digitization which is the core subject of the digital wave.,2
18,Videos that are presented in French could've been translated to English.,4
19,"The course content is quite good, though it could have been deeper in some areas.But its peer review system is not working well, if at all.Regards, An Le.",3
20,"Great piece of work, I especially liked a few 'lifehacks' for the CIO",5

23,Very interesting and well-designed MOOC !,5
24,Excellent course! Totally recommended!,5
25,Great course information and content ! Very interesting ! Unfortunately there is a peer graded assignment which 3 classmates must grade. Although two of my classmates gave me all passing grades one classmate gave me all 0's and didn't really justify why; which made me have to re submit my assignment. Thankfully 3 other amazing classmates saw the quality of my work :),4
26,Very interesting course. I learned a lot about the history of Aboriginal education.,5
27,Great content! Learned a lot.,5

45,"This is a really good survey class in the potential of 3d printing, with examples of how individuals can empower themselves and others without the obstacles of traditional tooling, with a relatively short learning curve and low investment. It also demonstrates the ways in which, now and increasingly in the future, we'll all be capable of designing the solutions to our own problems with increasing agility!The only thing that could make it better would be to have more design challenges!Thanks!",5
46,"Excellent course , enjoyed learning :)",5
47,Great course and very informative.,5
48,I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.,3
49,This course doesn't contain any new information. It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.,1
50,Great course. I enjoyed learning the material.,4
51,"Excellent course. Good classes, easy to follow, updated content, high quality videos.",5
52,It should be merged with course 1,3

54,very interesting,5
55,"Topics related to the economy or business are not something I am good at or enjoy reading about, this course helped me learn a bunch of useful things I would otherwise not have put effort into studying.",4
56,"I was able to understand materials and devices used in 3d printing, software aspects of 3d printers and get an introductory view of cutting edge applications such as 3d printing in biomedical applications",5
57,"This course is very interesting, enlightening and a wonderful introduction especially for learners with no prior experience with 3D printing.",5
58,Great information and videos. Ready for the next step.Gus,5
59,"If you are interested in having a deeper insight of the 3D printing technology, I recommend this course. There are no prerequisites, all you need is the desire to learn. This course will introduce to to you the different 3D manufacturing methods, and present to you to 3D printing companies that are presently actively. If you want to transitions into the 3D printing field, I believe this course is a good start.",5
60,Full Individuals speaking,3
61,It should be less repetitive and full of useful informations about applications.,3
62,Very good inspirational examples.,5
63,Great course. It provided a great degree of knowledge about applications and the design process.,5
64,it could be easily compressed in a two-weeks course.Sometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain.,3
65,good introduction into the applications of 3D printing.,3
66,good overview what you can do with this amazing technology.,5
67,This session was too long and a little boring. Could be shorter with the related contents.,3
68,exemplary examples to how 3d Printing can be applied to real world problems.,5
69,"Great content, I still need to go over it to glean the wealth of information that has been put together here.",5
70,"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.",2
71,"I do not find very interesting this course. too many interviews. It could works for the first course, but not for the second. I was expecting to have more technical material and lessons.",1
72,"Very good in-depth look at the potential applications for 3D printing. I especially liked the sections on development and education. This class gets you thinking about the potential ramifications of 3D printing and how it can change the economy, both locally and globally.",4
73,"A good course to see the various market and non-profit aspects of 3D printing. Lot of examples and initiatives, a",5
74,"Excellent course, could do with a little more visual references. Some of the talks are a bit tough to get through since you are watching 2 people. Content still very valuable.",4
75,"A very complete course, very interesting!",5
76,Great review of what can be accomplished through 3D printing.,5
77,Great class!,5
78,"Super! I did not expect the level of engagement needed to complete the course and it was a very pleasant surprise!Being a layman in the 3D printing revolution, this course really expanded my views on 3D printing.",5
79,A lot of speaking without any sense. Skip it at all cost,1
80,"This is a very basic course on 3D Printing Technology but every aspect of the technology is artistically explained. All the various points of view are considered and a 360 degree idea is passed on to the students.By taking this course, students who are contemplating about their involvement in this revolutionary technology will be able to finally decide their future course of action, which I believe will be positive.In short, this course will provide you a base whereas the further courses, I think (as I haven't taken up the rest of the courses till now but I intend to) will add sufficient value to your knowledge.Regards.",5
81,Great course! Thank you!,5

There are a plethora of interviews with people who are involved with the 3D printing industry, who discuss specific topics in 3D printing, and each offer their views on the future of 3D printing. All the different opinions and perspectives really helped me understand the importance of 3D printing at both an industry and consumer level.

180,"Thank you for this course, very good course.",5
181,"I am very glad to see courses like this one on Coursera. The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...£40..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Coursera already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only £32 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price. Although I am very happy to have access to the courses and I thank you for you effort!",4
182,This is a really great introductory course on 3D printing. I was completely new to the subject and in just two short modules both the basic techniques and some modern day applications were explained in a really clear and engaging manner.I was also really interested to learn about the business examples that made use of these new technologies.Recommended for anyone who is interested in new and exciting techniques!,5
183,Great endeavor! You can now learn about the 3D printing technology at your own place.,5
184,An excellent course. I only wish the portion on non-financial metrics included some examples or insight in how best to quantify non-financial metrics in do,5
185,"week 1 and 2 were kind of boring, but maybe necessary; weeks 3 and 4 were more interesting from a business point of view (i'm not so much interested in accounting as in business decisions).the virtual class of professor Bushee was quite funny :)",4
186,"Excellent course, first 3 weeks were very technical but highly informative. Quite a bit of accounting knowledge is required to understand the work. Last week of lessons were more simple and intuitive to understand, but overall, a very insightful module",5
187,"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations. Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here. ""I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to"" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're ""stocked"" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that ""we're going to run some narly regressions"", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants. These segments add absolutely zero value. They lengthen the time of the course. To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.",1
188,This is the first English course I have taken.Though at first it was kind of difficulty because of language(especially the terms) and profession knowledge(it is a comprehensive course and I am still learning courses concerned at school)the course is really worth taking. I have learned a lot .and it stimulates my interest in accounting.,5
189,Thanks for your help.,5

194,Very good course but videos sometimes too long,4
195,A fantastic course,5
196,Really fantastic and interesting intermediate accounting course,5
197,"weeks 1,2 and 3 were not satisfactory according to me. the video lectures were difficult to comprehend. week 4 was very good.",2
198,this is the best course that i ever studied it,5
199,"I love the professors, but unfortunately, I do not feel much connection to me (not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements; I am not an investor, and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements).The Managerial Accounting (week 4) transforms my mindset!! I really appreciate that. That one single week of course can literally help so many companies/NGOs. That week 4 should be promoted more!!",3
200,"This is fantastic course. The only catch is that it doesn't have Chinese translation, which makes it a little bit more difficult for non-natives to learn. The quality is great.",5
201,"I have only taken one year of accounting in high school before, but the course was really easy to comprehend and engaging!",4
202,It's a very good course.,4
203,The three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis.,2
204,"Course was not easy to grasp, lost interest after the first week and I barely got through the quiz at the end.",2
205,"This course is difficult for me since it requires extensive background of accounting studies while my background is in HR and Strategy. However, I grasped the opportunity to make up my finance and accounting related knowledge, and passed the course finally after several times of trial and error. The professors taught the course in a very interesting and fun way, which could have been a boring class with lots of difficult and hard numbers but turns out to be a class full of fun and laughters. I like the way the two professors are presenting the knowledge, as well as doing the analysis. Thanks for providing such a course! More courses like this should be organized to benefit more professionals or students in need!",5
206,Very useful material to financial review of cash flow statements.,4
207,"Very informative course. Prof. Bushee is hilarious,, really like his teaching technique",5
208,"not a big fan of accounting honestly, but i quite enjoy the course. doesn't involve a lot of in-depth math, and its easy to follow.",5
209,"The first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization, the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how non-financial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes. I really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life. A data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business, not finding his manager's earnings management using an M-score etc.",3
210,It was very well done and very informational. Thanks again professors for your dedication and time to educate society!,4
211,My major is accounting but I still felt that it was so difficult. But I learned some knowlege which our teachers didn't tell me. Thanks!,5
212,Departments rigidity to information sharing as an ailment at middle and lower organizational levels was a notable issue,5
213,"This course made me look at Accounting in a very different way; instead of common business schedules, it actually became exciting to read and find out what was really going on!",5
214,Most fruitful course for the most updated Accounting Analytics,5
215,Very informative and interactive. I like the style of Professor Bushee's classroom teaching,4
216,"I believe that it is a fantastic course for those have some basic accounting knowledge and the willingness to enter compliance area. More importantly, the concept linking financial and non-financial decisions are also fantastic to bring accounting to life! I do love both professors in the module!",5
217,great accounting ratio analysis,5
218,Good overview on Financial Analytics!,4
219,"This was very challenging course for me... I felt you needed a strong knowledge base of financial statements to really understand what triggers potential fraud, deception. I think I will need to re-review the course material to reinforce the concepts. Thanks!",5
220,Focus of first 3 week is more of an audit analytics material. Quiz material could have been more interactive. Overall OK course.,4
221,"An excellent course with Professor Bushee, as always (I completed a previous ten weeks course with him, also a superb quality programme of study), very practical, focused and complete, and absolutely enjoyable.",5
222,"Interesting course. Motivating instructors. Tests were sometimes a bit too much about semantics and too little about applying knowledge in a practical way (which the course intro hinted on). But it was good value, manageable next to job and private life and fun to do. You won't regret it.",4
223,This has been a challenging course for a person that doesn't have any accounting experience,4
224,"Professors need to undergo a presentation and Instruction Design skills. They were talking a lot and everything was going over my head, the reason was there were not visual prompt for the examples, specifically in the last week.",1
225,Excellent overview of identification of problems in financial statements,5
226,"This is an excellent course, especially for someone with near zero knowledge of financial statements and their analysis. The concepts are clearly presented, with interesting details and supporting examples of their use. The inane comments by cartoon characters using poorly simulated accents is only mildly irritating.",4
227,Interesting course with good and clear explanation. Easy to understand and with fun!Thank you!,5
228,Very clear. Excellent instructor and it's free if you don't pay for the cert! Can you have a better class experience? Thank you Prof. Bushee!,5
229,Wonderful! Very convenient discourse and utterly concise.,5
230,A very interesting course. Strengthening the advanced accounting concepts.,5
231,It was very breathtakingly and I think that it is the best course within the Business Analytics specialization.,5
232,difficult for people without accounting background to take.,3
233,Good structure... funny prof! ... alot to digest but worth it.,5
234,"The contrast of provided material is quite huge. In first for weeks all the analytics are explained and decisions are shown, in the last week only principles and overall concepts are introduced.",4
235,"I have many hours of undergraduate accounting and finance course work under my belt and this class gives you a tremendous overview of financial statement analysis. The only disadvantage is that the professor creates the workbooks for you and you only have to answer conceptual questions. While this would be great for some, I was hoping for some more hands on work to practice.",4
236,"Excellent Material and instructions. Hard, but valuable",5
237,"Although I am not a native speaker,but I try me best to understand it!Good teacher!Good Coursera!",5
238,Very insightful topic! A good overview of the use of analytics in accounting!,4
239,"was worth the time, thanks professor",5
240,I have thoroughly enjoyed this course. The whole idea of earning management was cool. I will highly recommend this course to all.,5
241,"Awesome Course! Very funny and really sophisticated! The last part is eye opening. Best course in this specialisation!It is not for beginners though, you should have a solid understanding of accounting for the first 3 lectures.",5
242,"Besides serving as a refresher of a few accounting topics, this course really delivers on the topics of analyzing financial statements for possible fraud and linking non-financial metrics to financial performance.",5
243,I really appreicated the tools and techniques presented in the course. Very very valuable for Merger and Acqusition projects that I will be involved in (if ever),5
244,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.,4
245,i love professor Brian J Bushee!!,5
246,Great concise lectures and examples. Useful supplemental files. Entertaining Q&A in Brian's sessions.,5
247,"Rather robust material with strong focus on ""deceptive"" practice detection. A lot of ratio analyses, each with its own moniker which I found tedious. Informative and confirmed that I don't have the ""accountant gene"".",4
248,"Sorry to say but among the four courses of this specialization, this one really disappointed me. Not the fault of teachers or institute, i think the only mistake they made is try to fit too many topics in one course. Anyway this is only my opinion!",3
249,Amazing Course!,5
250,Very practical and complementary for other accounting courses.,5
251,The best auditing course out there!,5
252,"The first 3 weeks demonstrate how to analyze financial performance based on accounting data taken from a company's reported income and investment decisions (10-K for example). The material is presented in an interesting manner with extensive use of Excel spreadsheets to demonstrate the calculation and application of common performance metrics and ratios. The test are challenging and interesting. I retook test I had passed because the information cover was interesting and the test provided an excellent learning opportunity. The fourth week deals with liking non-financial measures to financial performance. Within a typical organization, these parameters are often the ones employees most affect and are often measured against. The concepts and methods of evaluating presented with examples to demonstrate some of the problems with linking non-financial measures to financial performance.I will be able to use what I have learned from both of these classes in my current job. I evaluate current business strategies of my company against competitive business strategies. Since the competitive business strategies must be deduced from a combination of published information and reported financial performance, the first three weeks will be of greatest benefit in this aspect of my job. The last week will be of more benefit as I help business organization within my company develop their business strategies.",5
253,Great content but animations are annoying!,3
254,"With my Accounts/Business/Finance/Statistics Graduation/Post Graduation Education and Teaching & Work Experience, I believe the Professor/Educator who Designed and Presented this Course requires atleast a Basic Training before putting together an important Course like Accounting Analytics.",3
255,Too far from subject,2
256,"The course and the instructor are great, but a missed some referenced material.",4
257,Thanks to the Professor Brian Bushee for the good explanations. I learned a lot. I find the module 4 so difficult for me. The Prof Christopher Ittner is speaking like CNN journalist and not easy for a non native US or English speaker like me to follow.,4
258,I love to be taught accounting by Sir Brian. A very marvellous course.,5
259,Great Course,5
260,"Really good teachers that made a ""boring"" theme (that I had in college) very interesting to watch and study.",5
261,Very good course well presented especially as the topic can be fairly complex.,4
262,Week 4 was the best and the more appropiate for the specialization.,4
263,"Thank you for offering this course. It has taught me a lot of things that I hadn't known. I'm interested in Accounting and there were some times I didn't know where I could gain the materials for study. Now thanks to your courses, I don't need to worry so much. Hope you will continue to produce more",5
264,The Capstone project has been getting delayed since JanDont expect yourself to complete the specialization,1
265,"There was a gap between the prerequisites mentioned on the course details and those stated by Prof. Bushee during the lectures. As such, I found this course a bit harder due to tons of new terminologies in accounting.",4
266,Best course of the specialisation so far.,5
267,Prof Brian Bushee is really excellent but I felt that Prof Chris Ittner's lecture was quite fluffy for an analytics course. Would have appreciated practice problems and case study practices like the operation analytics class,3
268,This course was very informative and can easily be used in any business setting. I can go an apply the methods learned in this course to any organization's financial statement to get a better idea of their financial performance. I really enjoyed in week 4 how the information learned in prior weeks can be tied to nonfinancial measures in developing a causal model to improve the performance of a company.,5
269,Thank you so much for this good-quality course! I benefit a lot. Many thanks to dear professors!,5
270,"Really useful course, concise and resourceful",4
271,"Very interesting course, well designed, using animated fun-makers to shoot out questions that you will probably do it yourself.Course content easy to understand. Very suited for non-accounting major analyst who wants to get some background in accounting analysis..",5
272,Very boring,1
273,"Easiest accounting common sense. If you ever took acct , this will be a wasting of time.",1
274,"While each of the Business Analytics courses have been terrific in their own way, Accounting Analytics was the most challenging and most enjoyable. Accounting + clear information + dogs + sense of fun = a great course. Thank you!",5
275,Extremely useful! I recommend it :),5
276,Very interesting course!,5
277,Content very clear and explained by the professors.,4
278,Brain Bushee's videos are really impressive. Some areas are too technical for a beginner to understand. The rest of the material provide good understanding...,4
279,"Excellent course, professor Bushee always delivers such great explanations.",5
280,I really appreciate this instructor!! He is so considerate!,5
281,Great course!,5
282,Very interesting and provocative course. It will help you to receive additional knowledge which is very valuable.,5
283,"Bushee was fantastic! Ittner was fine, but not as entertaining as Bushee.",4
284,"Extremely useful, powerful and course",5
285,"I loved the Accounting part of the course. It was quite hard for me (non-accounting person), however I really enjoyed the form of the lectures and the content itself (the earnings management + its revealing). Great materials Professor Bushee!",4
286,the Best cour and the Best sitetanks,4
287,"I bit too complicated, as a lot of material placed within 4 weeks of ~15min videos.",4
288,"I recommend this course to all my colleagues. Its enriched content certainly helped me to understand things in better way and provided content in structured way, which is I liked most.",5
289,"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to. I enrolled in the Business Analytics Specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside, not outside. Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level. I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard.",2
290,Great course. Fantastic ideas around modelling equity returns based business and operational performance,5
291,good overview of analytics options within accounting.,5
292,Great course and great insights!,5
293,"Great working examples to learn Analytics in Financial Statement Analysis. Pace of videos was great. Working excel worksheet gives perfect hands on experience to vary and run the scenarios. Having done ""Introduction to Financial Accounting"" by same professor gave little bit more visibility into reading statements and understanding ratio analysis.Virtual Classroom is getting more new students in each course. I am looking forward to Advance Financial Accounting course.",5
294,Great! As always great lectures by professor Bushee!,5
295,"Very well done! Contents, delivery, clarity, everything was top notch. Thank you!",5
296,This course was one of the toughest courses i pursued so far... I was expecting a lot from this course. from basic to advanced and more of fundamentals. this course should be floated as full specialization rather than as a part of other specialization.,5
297,"This was a good course, no doubt about it. But i felt, that the subject needed more depth that the course framework allowed. I would have liked if it had a part 2 for this course for people who wanted to go little more hands-on in this subject.",4
298,Finally i am able to complete this course. This course was little tougher than the other 3 courses due to some complicated accounting spreadsheet calculations. But i finally i am able to make it. Good Luck to rest of the folks.,5
299,The Best Course in Accounting Analytics.,5
300,Very well thought out. Many useful and applicable techniques provided that can be put to work immediately.,4
301,The course was very helpful. Thanks a lot to everyone who have made this happen!,5
302,"I would add more examples on how to populate the data, even spend time on optional videos where the professor or his assistant goes through testing ratios (something similar to Operations Analytics). I feel like the professor was rushing through his explanations and the models. Maybe people found the course very useful however I felt like there was too much text and immediate switch to Excel file that was elaborated shortly. Overall, I am not sure how to apply these ratios in my final project...",3
303,"First of all, I would like to express my gratefulness to Coursera who presenting this excellent platform for those who is interested in ongoing lifetime education and hardworking and contributions to bring all the greatest courses from top universities around the world.Second, I thank you Prof Brian and Christopher for all your time, work especially your knowledge that you brought and shared within these videos. I truly appreciate and like the way you teaching and delivering the professional knowledge.To me, as a student who's just started stepping in accounting field, I found that accounting classes is so much interesting done by you, and it is a pure enjoyment as I learnt all the key knowledge. On there other hand, the courses gave me a general clear picture of how important and critical the accounting is in daily business management.I will continue study accounting as I pursue my professional goals and career path.",5
304,Lot of considerably complex and dry (accounting and statistics!) subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion! Quiz questions are unnecessarily complex - which (IMHO) will discourage / turn off those who are new to this subject matter in completing this course. The last week is pretty interesting though!I am taking the full business analytic course - and find that the quality and complexity of content is all over the place!! Some are way too simple and some are highly complex.,2
305,"really informative, original and useful!",4
306,This course provides a deeper insight into financial and nonfinancial performance on a pragmatic basis. However the course itself is really brief and the exercises cannot thoroughly provide reliable measure of the understanding of the lectures.,4
307,The course makes accounting interesting and especially the examples are very illustrative. Virtual students bring some fun. The 4th week is however really integrated in the course structure.,5
308,Definitely good course for those working in either accounting or analytics. It gave me new ideas on how to apply analytical methods. Interesting examples on how to identify number management and how analytics can help to set up non-financial metrics that drive financial outcomes.,4
309,Insightful,4
310,Incredibile package.,5
311,"I liked it, although I felt like they were 2 courses: One for the first three weeks, another one during the last week.The ""First Course"" was OK, but it was regular accounting stuff. I was rusty on that so I enjoyed it.The ""Second Course"" was the one related with Analytics.I give it 3 Stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team. And because didn't made a proper link between Accounting and Analytics.",3
312,Thanks a lot for putting up such an amazing course,5
313,"Challenging course, a mixture of forensic and investigation method in accounting",5
314,A technical but fun exploration of accounting analytics which completed the full gamut of analytics in a business context covered in the specialization.,5
315,Prof Brain is just superb. His hold and teaching ability of complicated subject of accounting is unmatched.,5
316,Thank you!,5
317,Vote for Pro. Bushee!,5
318,Good course if you are a beginner. Analytics is only 1 module (#3) and it is a good one.,4
319,Excellent course for aspiring financial analysts,5
320,i love this course very much!very practical and systematical content.and very useful for accounting professionbut its a little bit challenging to follow. I have watched whole the videos for more than 2 times in order to pass the assignment.,5
321,"It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs. I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all. There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace. It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly. The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers. It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost. It was pretty good, though. I liked how it contained specific examples and charts.",3
322,Great introduction to Accounting Analytics. Unexpected lecturing dialogues. Could have more analytics or additional or optional problem sets to explore more deeply.,3
323,"I believe this is a very good course. Even I'm am a software engineer, I can understand how to manipulating the finacial report and how to detect them.",5
324,The Professor is really amazing. He makes every lecuture interesting and easy to understand.,5
325,Outstanding teacher and metodology. Best course of this kind i've come accross out of Business Schools and MBAs.,5
326,Excellent Designed course. Thanks,5
327,Excellent online course that caters to a wide spectrum of audiences with different learning backgrounds.Also love the cut scenes to the classroom where students make funny comments or ask questions haha,5
328,"Five stars is not enough to express my satisfaction and love to this course.The instructor is very proactive in community. Every questions I posted got direcly feedback from Teaching staff (and most of them are from Prof Bushee!!!)This is the besttttt course among all Wharton analytics sessions! Honestly, you have to try!!",5
329,"A little tough sometimes, but very instructive",4
330,"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the “tell me what I just told you type” but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students “play” with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two… “change the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?” I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going “yeah… that makes sense. I understand…” I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don’t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require “parroting” something said in the video.I’m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder’s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a “think about what this means” type question that is not necessarily “marked” but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they “go look at the spreadsheet”. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more “hand holding” and “direction” in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little “scary” for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I’m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes – this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 – Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 – talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an “increase means slower future recognition”. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 – no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford’s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures – some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students – particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students – perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don’t need to be long or complicated – just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to “play” with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of “messing” it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a “playground” sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another – so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios – one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don’t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live.",4
331,"Thank you very much for this awesome course, I really enjoyed and learned alot from it.I really liked the selected topics, they act like an intro to some really interesting fields in the programming.I've learned about NP multiple times but never found a use to it until now, the problems were really good and informative.I think the linear programming was pretty rushed, it should've been expanded over two weeks with more in details.Maybe add a problem or explain the use of duality .",5
332,"I didn't like that course because of:-weak explanations of algorithms-almost all assignments I googled, I spent all my time googling these algorithms-when code is submitted and something goes wrong It is not possible to understand what is really happened",1
333,Nice one.,5
334,poor course. never give any algorithm. No clue where the problem come from. The forum is only help a few people. No general ideas how to solve the problem. waist a lot of time debugging but still couldn't pass the assignment.total waste my time and garbage course.,1
335,While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course. I had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so I had to look around in the internet for additional resources. Nonetheless it was a satisfying experience though it took me a lot of time and effort to complete the assignments.,3
336,"Loved what I learnt, I also implemented a project using Google MAP API for the organization I'm working at",5
337,"Inadequate student and teacher participation on forums, leaving students to figure things out without assistance or collaboration. Insufficient explanation of math concepts required to fully understand lectures.",2
338,"The problems are really challenging, thank you! However, the instructor is not very active in the discussion forum, which is a pity when you really need help and get stucked in the problem set.",4
339,"Excellent but tough course ,you need to work and it is not simply called advanced Algorithms and Complexity.You will be forced to test your code properly ,even if you didn't do it properly in the previous specialisation course.",5
340,Thank you very much. I learned a lot in this course. I recommend it!,5
341,"I enjoyed the course a lot. I cannot thank the instructors enough.It would have been more interesting if we could go deeper on linear programming, such as extension to integer programming. The discussion about the duality was a bit too fast to me.",5
342,"easy to undestand, but it needs more examples",3
343,Good one!,5
344,"Great intro to Ableton, with good hands-on experience. Nice starting point for those who seek to expand their music creation toolset.",5
345,great fun and easy to learn.,5
346,"I personally think that I've learnt more from Google and YouTube then in this course. You can join the course for certification. Other then the certificate, I find this course not much of value.",3
347,The course gives a good basic overview of the softwareAs a newbie to DAW software it helpsActually needed it to determine if I was going to purchase the full versionI will be,5
348,Offers a nice introduction to Ableton and its Usage. However it would have been lovely if this was a longer course.. Loved the way of instructions and the topics covered.,4
349,really great course,5
350,Really useful for beginners!!,4
351,must have if you want to start using ableton,5
352,"Excellent course.Great content, tasks and learning environment.It helped me to rediscover my love for creating music and how well suited Ableton is to my way of working.",5
353,"Good as a introduction, but there was only a few people on blend so it was hard to earn their votes, hope there will apear some intermediate or advanced courses.",4
354,"Great introduction to Ableton 9 for a newcomers. You'll learn basics, but those that are enough to start create music.",5
355,Awesome course for an intro or to just refresh your skills.,5
356,it's awesome for beginners!,5
357,"Cool, The best i did on line.I learned a lotThanks you very much.",5
358,to easy. enjoy everyone! also children to old papa anyone.thanks for Erin Barra,5
359,"Great introduction to Ableton. If you love music, this can change the way you create sounds, melodies, rhythms,...",4
360,If only it was a week longer.,4
361,This is a great course for people who do not know Ableton. The exercises were easy to understand.,5
362,"A very good course for getting a quick and effective introduction to one of the coolest DAWs around! Barra has explained everything nicely, and in an easy to grasp manner. Go ahead if you're looking for digital music production even remotely!",4
363,Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!,4
364,Mo comment went way too fast no contact not deep,1
365,"As thorough as possible given the time constraints. Erin Barra did a terrific job of condensing the material . I ended up appreciating the appeal of Ableton Live -- which is to say, a non-linear, clip-based DAW. The program (and Push) is endless, and I'm still learning all sorts of things. Good to have this basic foundation to work from. Thanks....!",5
366,Great for beginners and if you want to get into Ableton DAW,5
367,"Very good course, I really wish for a next more advanced level course.",5
368,"Excellent experience. Material, instructor and pace of the course were really good.",4
369,A well-presented and thorough introduction to the fundamental tools available in Ableton Live.,5
370,A great course to teach the basics of this software!,5
371,Thank you Ms professor Erin Bara you are the pest,5
372,"Gives a soft view and precise information about what to do and how to do in Live.If you are looking for some input to start recording yourself or to start creating any kind of music, i strongly recommend this!",4
373,Great class for learning the fundamentals and basics within Ableton live 9. Projects are realistic and designed to educate a student no matter their level of knowledge.,5
374,Great for getting me started. I feel much more confident in navigating my way around the Ableton workspace. Using blend has opened me up to some wonderful ideas and opportunities :),4
375,Please create another course,5
376,Fantastic and helps you create music that represents you.,5
377,Fully recommend if you want to dive into Ableton Live,5
378,Great course with an even greater lecturer who helps ease users into Ableton Live.,5
379,I learned so much in this class and the instructor did a great job explaining the contents,5
380,Great course!,5
381,Very light and practical course. Good for beginners but also nice to refresh some tips for intermediate users.,5
382,it's a great course for people who want to learn easily the base of this program!,5
383,Very helpful in acquiring necessary knowledge about Live. I would recommend this course to several others like me interested to get their hands on Ableton.,4
384,An excellent introduction to an extremely powerful Digital Audio Workstation - one which I had used for a few months but still learned a great deal from the course.Highly recommended. :),5
385,Great course,5
386,Don't recommend.You're better off skimming through the ableton manual and using the search function to get the answers you want.,1
387,Good course . A must take for beginners !,4
388,Great introductory course for ableton!,5
389,"I loved! Easy to learn, easy to understand. Now i can to use my Ableton and work on my productions. Very nice teacher!",5
390,"Simply an introduction but definitely helps learn the program, at least on a surface level. You will gain basic functionality and be well on your way to crafting more complex arrangements if you desire.",5
391,Erin Barra is an excellent teacher; one of the best I've ever encountered. The course plan is well thought out and structured so that absolute beginners as well as those with Ableton experience can benefit. Highly recommend!!!,5
392,Really great course! The videos were very clear and I learned a ton about a program I've been using for years to record audio only.,5
393,"One of the best introduction to Ableton Live. This course is sharp, to the point and makes you sketch out a small track every week - a great way to get involved with the DAW.",5
394,Loving this course,5
395,Great course to start working your way around all the incredible tools Ableton offers.,5
396,I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.,3
397,Excellent overview and practice for new ableton live users.,5
398,"I have learned so much about using Ableton Live in this course. It really gives you the basic of the program and then some which is really great, especially when you want to use this program for producing and or recording. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Ableton and Berklee Online.",5
399,Excellent to start learning.,5
400,"It's a great course. The teacher is the best, very direct and understandable.",5
401,As an introduction course its very helpful. It has just what you need to get started.,5
402,"A very nice experience. I expected an entry level course, but Erin organised a well rounded path. I got a new effective approach to the Ableton Live 9 software.I recommend to develop carefully your assignments: you will improve your own skills by comparing your solutions with those of the classmates. In addiction you'll find some ""veteran"" student willing to help.Good luck!",5
403,"While I did not have time to complete the final assignment I did find this course useful for creating a firmer understanding of Ableton Live. The peer review process is a great idea and something which I found to be both engaging and useful for networking with fellow artists.The content of the course I feel is probably useful to someone with no prior knowledge of DAWs, but this is not my first DAW. As such the course felt a little slow and the assignments a little unchallenging. Personally my peer review experience ranged from listening to fully fleshed out ideas to listening to uninspired loops of nonsense. I still feel as though I benefited from the process, however, and I gained an invaluable resource in Blend.I would love a next level - fleshing out some of the ideas touched on throughout the course, as well as exploring other ideas such as sidechaining.",4
404,I've started producing with live in a week. Amazing and clear course.,5
405,Brilliantly designed course for fundamental understanding of the DAW.,5
406,"This course covers a lot of ground in a short period of time, and does it in a way that makes it easy to quickly leverage the power of Ableton in production and live performance. I appreciated the simplicity and thoroughness of the videos, and the assignments kept me motivated. It's a great class for complete beginners, as well as intermediate users in need of a brush up. Erin has a good approach to teaching: she's efficient and clear, and her basic examples don't overwhelm the student.",5
407,it's a great introduction to ableton but nothing more,4
408,Keeps me connected to music and music technology even in my work life,5
409,"Learned a lot. Got me started and using the program, and making music.",4
410,"This is a great intro class, designed to be completed within the Ableton trial period. Ableton should pay Erin a commission on sales that come out of this course, because I imagine it's bringing them 100s of new sales!The materials (mostly videos) are excellent and easy to follow. I learned a lot in this short class and would love to see an ""intermediate"" Ableton class in the future.My only complaints are related to the collaboration software that you need to use for this course, blend.io. Site navigation in blend.io can be painfully slow, and the site is buggy. I would have preferred to simply share information via dropbox or some other file sharing method.The peer review process is a great idea, although I think it's really tricky to do this in a music/art, because there is so much subjectivity and not much of a rubric. (There are some quantitative questions just to verify that the student follows instructions, but the open feedback is totally open). But, overall, the peer review works pretty well and gives students an additional incentive to turn in a quality product.",5
411,Great course. Won't say anything else... if you want to know how it is you must try it!,5
412,"Great introduction to Ableton Live. Covers all stuff you need to know, and helps you through some stumbling blocks.",5
413,"Excellent introduction to live 9. Very comprehensive, easy to understand.",5
414,Awesome course for those who want to learn Ableton´s Live DAW!,5
415,Excellent for learning the basics!,5
416,"Great course! For very short time you'll learn so many amazing things. You will know in depth one professional software for music composition. You'll create 3 compositions which will be placed in musical website and hundreds or thousand of other musicians will hear it and vote for it. You will be part of wonderful group of other musicians like you taking part in the same course. You will be able to discuss with them important subject's... Great course. Thank you, Erin, David!",5
417,Really good resource for anyone wanting to learn the basics of a super flexible software.,4
418,"Great instructor, I like how you can go back and keep going over the instructional videos throughout the course.",5
419,This course is a challenging into to Ableton Live. It is well worth the time for even experienced producers who are new to Ableton Live. I first got Ableton Live in November 2015. It is now January 2016 and I feel like I have come a long way thanks to this course.,5
420,Fun course! Excellent for beginners. By week two you are able to make an arrangement already.,5
421,"Great to start with Ableton, even i start with some youtube tutorial, this course really works for me cause i can see some errors i did.",5
422,interesting and easy learning!,5
423,"The MOOC teaches what it is supposed to, although more classes would be nice since Ableton is such a big program.",5
424,Erin is a great and easy to follow instructor! Thank you.,5
425,"Great Course, lots of feedback from your assignments!",5
426,"anyway, I can start to make music after this course.",5
427,Thank you so much for this course. Really... very neccesary and important for people who loves music.,5
428,"I never ever would have gotten started with Ableton if it weren't for Erin's course. She made it SO easy to understand. For years, people have tried to explain it to me but only Erin succeeded in making it sink in! This course ROCKS.",5
429,Very good course for learning how to work in Ableton. Professor Barra teaches really great.,5
430,GREAT!! thanks a lot :) :),5
431,"The course is an awesome intro. It could be longer! These Coursera Berklee courses are so short, sometimes they feel like advertisements for the Berklee online courses.",5
432,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The time commitment required for each week's assignment was perfect. I learned several techniques to aid me in going forward in my musical endeavors and look forward to many years of continuing to explore Ableton Live.,5
433,Great course waiting for level 2 :),5
434,Great course! Helped me to get started with Ableton Live.Video lectures were straight to the point.,5
435,Excellent! the best way to learn!,5
436,"At this moment, I'm in the week 2 and I'm loving it...I'd really recommend it.",5
437,Very good instructions of the teacher!,4
438,"Very good introduction to this software, teatcher is great and very easy to understand. I have learned a lot of good stuffs such as how to warp audio, convert audio to midi and so on... I was used to work on cubase and I have discovered the specifities and the advantages of Live.Moreover thanks to the assignment objectives I had to force myself to be creative and It was a great feelig.Thanks for this course :)",4
439,Great starting point for learning how to use Ableton Live.,5
440,"Really nice.. Basic, but just right..",5
441,This course got me fluent enough with using Ableton that I can sit down and play around with it comfortably and create music. Very pleased,5
442,"This was such a cool way to get started again with music production!!...I'm so glad I found this course, and Erin was perfect, she made everthing so clear and easy...I wish it was a longer course tho!",5
443,"It's amazing that we live in an age where you can take online classes like this for free.I went from not knowing my way around Ableton to being able to make simple tracks in a few weeks.The course load is pretty light, but it makes it easy to stay motivated and keep up from week to week.The instructor has her quirks, but don't we all. I feel like this course is great for introducing someone who has prior experience with writing music and using DAWs to Ableton Live. However, for someone who already knows the basics of Live, this probably won't be of too much use.",3
444,I enjoyed very much the lessons and I had a very good time on preparing the assignment on Ableton.A great course.,5
445,"It helped me to improve myself, understanding Ableton Live and getting better in working with the program.",5
446,"Awesome, Useful, very practical! Erin is a wonderful instructor.",5
447,A great course. It does teach you the essentials on how to begin making music with Ableton live. It even helps you search on your own if you troubleshoot. Its definitely worth it!!!,5
448,Very good course for does how just starting with Ableton.,5
449,"Great, specifically for its collaborative approach.",5
450,"This is an amazing course ! it is my second time taking it. Instructor Erin Barra does a great job with the tutorials, she really knows her stuff.",5
451,I have being waiting for this a long time :),5
452,Good information!,4

454,"work motivational, very clear, well structured on a steady groove ... excellent!",4
455,Very good basic course. Enjoyed it very much,5
456,I am very grateful i came across this Course.,5
457,Very interesting.,4
458,Very useful !,5
459,Its just the best!,5
460,Great Introduction into the program....a quick look. I felt the tutorial in the program covered a lot and most of the info here can be found on youtube. Although you don't get a certificate for watching youtube,4
461,It is very nice for people are starting with abletobn program,4
462,"For anyone getting started this is a great course to do it with. I'm retaking this course as a refresher since I took the same class in the beginning of the year. I've been very busy so I forgot some functions. The videos & explanations make it very easy to get reacquainted. Plus what's more fun than getting some more production in, hearing your own creations & everyone else's for that matter. =)",5
463,"This is already very, very helpful with mastering the use of Ableton, understanding how the I/O functions work, and polishing a track to the mastering level. Great program and very intuitive!",5
464,Great overall introduction to start creating straight away. Liked it much!,5
465,"Great course, I just wanted it to be more thorough :) But for beginners like me, it really helped a lot! Thank you!",4
466,Excellent introduction to Ableton,5
467,Definitely recommend this short course which gives a good overview of Ableton Live's capabilities and how to use them.,5
468,I love it!,5
469,"good, straight to the point Course, you can learn other things in this course like Blend.io",5
470,I'm now taking this course a second time because it is so absolutely helpful and has really given me a free and friendly place to learn how to use Ableton and get started on music production!,5
471,Very helpful,5
472,Erin Barra is awesome..!!! Really good course to get up to speed with ableton.,5
473,Excellent Course... Erin Barra is really excellent in teaching. Now I can proudly say even i can work in ableton live nicely. Thank you Coursera,5
474,Great intro. Really gave me confidence with the DAW.,4
475,You don´t need anything else to get started with Ableton...,5
476,This is a great course to introduce anyone interested in music production. I would recommend this course to any and everyone. Thank you Berklee and Erin! Can you tell I enjoyed this.And the Beats continue.Johanna -JKM,5
477,"Really, really nice for learning the basics of Ableton Live. The instruction videos are short and concise, and there's a clear path forward after the course.",5
478,Great class to get your feet wet with ableton.,5
479,Everything on this course was amazing!Congrats and thanks so much for all!,5
480,Great course. Got me started off with Ableton live. :),4
481,"It was fun. Have peer review is helpful. However, it was mainly one time comment. It would be great to start conversation and interaction among course takers.",4
482,Great tools and solid instructions. Thanks!,5
483,This was an excellent course that was well explained and easy to follow.,5
484,"Fun and interesting course. I learned a lot, despite already being a Live user. Reviewing the assignments of other course-takers widened my horizons and helped me gain valuable insights.",5
485,"Real a great course if you are looking to learn the basics of Ableton Live 9 or just need a refresher after the break. Erin does a wonderful job of explaining the basics with out overloading you with to much information. Each assignment is to make a song. It starts with basic stuff and works toward more advanced stuff near the end. It's helped motivate me to put more time into making music and use the tools and software that I have at my disposal.A personal thanks to Erin, this class is just what I needed!",5
486,"Fantastic Course, i have saved the videos so i can review them again.I thoroughly enjoyed it, all over again. This was the second time i joined Introduction to Ableton Live but this time i decided to get my verified Certificate yay! Thank you Erin!",5
487,"Thank you so much Jeff, iy was usefull course, i think it needs to extend the material and learning's period.Thank you so much!!!",4
488,Very excellent class. Lots of great information.,5
489,i had a great knowledge !thanks for offering this course i don't have such course in india .,4
490,Very nice course,5
491,Awesome Course. It was quite challenging though,5
492,"This particular module (week 3) is written for those students who are already have at least a nodding acquaintance with the software.The videos move so fast that I am not able to detect what is going on. Please believe me when I say that I run a copy of Fusion 360 at the same time as a particular instructional video is playing. I toggle from one to another, taking notes from the instructional video when possible. Still, it takes me weeks, not days, to understand what the professor is doing.It is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within Fusion 360. I have been reviewing the tutorials that I am able to find -- and I have learned quite a bit of ""how-to"" information that this particular module does not provide.Why is it that some of us who are new to the Fusion 360 environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to ""fill in the blanks"" of week 3?Are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in Week 3? If so, why?Bill Clark",3
493,"This course introduced me to the different software tools that can be used for 3D Printing. I recommend this course, as well as this specialization, to anyone interested in 3D Printing.",5
494,more details on ther software would definitely be useful,5
495,"The instructor does an excellent job, but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a 3D software program after a week or two to earn a certificate. The certificate is worthless in my opinion. I liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs. a class of any proficiency required.",3
496,"The course was enjoyable for the most partand I increased my skill level. The videos, for the most part, were good. However, consider revising some of the one for Fusion to include demonstrations for the sweep, loft, and revolve tools in the Sculpt mode if they are to be included in assignments. These were not as intuitive as the others and required reliance on videos found on Autodesk as well as Youtube. Additionally, it would be helpful to slow the pace in illustrating ""how-to"" in the videos. There seemed to be steps omitted and I found it difficult at times to reconstruct all the steps. Finally, I noticed that staff/mentor help was not readily available for weeks, when participants posted queries in the forum.",4
497,This class was inspiring! I't was worth the wait. Thank you!!,5
498,Very interesting course. Maybe Fusion 360 may have lasted one more week to get more indepth knowledge,5
499,"I wanted to give only 4 stars because of the all the “problems” we encountered, but then we are learners investigating problem solving by design thinking. We can handle whatever comes, so the fifth star is for us. We are shaping this course by contributing to forums. Presumably we are ten thousand strong, let’s improve our worldwide voice by saying something on forms so we can get what we need and want we want also to stay on the cutting edge of reality.",5
500,Interesting and very useful course.,5
501,It gave me a good understanding of the software capabilities.,5
502,the introduction to Fusion is more a customer presentation to advanced CAD user than a tutorial for newbies.,2
503,Wow! It was such an inspiring journey!,5
504,"The bi-weekly assignments mixed with the bi-weekly lessons is a really great course structure. The audio on some of the videos interviews can be poor, and I wish some lectures, especially the last one were more in depth, but over all great course with a good pace.",4
505,Excellent course you should make more courses like this,5
506,"it was really an amazing experience , wonderful course with a lot of knowledge to learn , a lot of facilitations that make studying process very interesting , thanks a lot for your efforts , I'm very enthusiastic to have a visit to the Leiden medical school and center one day ^_^ and continue to learn from such a great medical staff =D",5
507,I loved this course. I've been teaching Anatomy to physical therapist students for two years and this course helped me a lot to improve my teaching. Thank you for your hard work!,5
508,Very interesting course! Great videos and instructors. T,5
509,I'm so glad Leiden University is working with Coursera. Such a great course!,4
510,"This is a great course, i am happy that you gave me the opprtunnity to get a certificate. Its a subject i really feel i gain more knowledge now.",5
511,"Well-organised , Very good for beginners and intermediate learners .",5
512,Great course!,5
513,i never saw like this very very amazing worki would like to repeat this course 10 times,5
514,I love it ! Thanks for doing this for us,5
515,iam soooo happy to joined to this course which help me to evaluate my skills and increase it,5
516,A good refresher in abdominal anatomy. Though with some negatives. The accent was difficult to understand at first. Most of the course content is for beginners in undergraduate level. Yet it is still good.,4
517,Do you have an idea how lucky you are to have access to a course like this?! Normally you would have to be enrolled in med school.,5
518,Fantastic videos walking through anatomy on a real human body!,5
519,difficult course that is full of information but if anatomy is your 'thing' then this is a very good course to take.,5
520,incredible content and resources!,5
521,"I really want to thank you all! In fact ,i never have experienced that awsome lecture! The embryology is the most diffucule lesson to me,and through this lecture,I don't think it is boring and hard to understand.At the same time, I really acknowledge using what you have leraned is the coolist thing in the world.You can figure out how responsible the teachers are(include every individuals who participate in this lecture's making) !thank you all again!!",5
522,Perfect,5
523,"Tough course, but fascinating and very well presented. I was never going to pass the final test because I just do not need to know the detail. However, I'm very grateful to have got to the finish line. Thank you.",5
524,amazing course help me alot,5
525,"is a very very boring curse, don't recommend anyone, please for your good at everyboduy else kill this course, don't embarrass yourself and the universities that represents",1
526,"Outstanding, clear, well-explained, not overwhelming. Dissections really aid to have a more realistic understanding. Good supplemental materials cover the material with great focus, and if more details are needed it is easy to get those elsewhere. Great effort by U. Leiden!",5
527,it is a very good course escpecially for medical student,5
528,Just awesome!,5
529,Excellent!!! I am impressed; they explain very well and it is very interesting to learn from them despite their accent.,5
530,great course with great dissection videos. course materials are very interesting. I understood the anatomy of the abdomen which medical school couldn't teach me.,5
531,very hard course but extremely detailed one.,5
532,I am dropping this course. don't e-mail any more for this course. How do I unroll in this course.,1
533,"V difficult, but rewarding!I did not get the grade I thought I would in this class...but I learned a lot more than I thought I could! Very in depth and thorough, I think I value the knowledge I received more than the sub-par grade I received. ;)",5
534,"The course itself is 10 out of 10: overwhelmingly informative, presented in a totally engaging manner, lots and lots of visual aids. Fly in the ointment: teaching assistants (called mentors here) apparently have come from very different (including hierarchical) societies and learners are required to take the mentors' diversified background and attitude into consideration. Not vice versa.",4
535,very hard but excellent course,5
536,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.,5
537,"Nice course, a difficult one but very challengeable. Nice structure and easy to understand.I wanted to refresh my knowledge in anatomy and in such gained a whole lot more in return.Thanks to the Professors for their time and effort in making this MOOC.Very pleased.",4
538,"Not meant for learners new to the medical field. Despite the challenges, the material is very fascinating and anyone interested in anatomy will learn something. The course utilizes outside research. I might enjoy the whole course experience more if the design were not so technical. I do, however, appreciate the challenge and seriousness of the topic.",4
539,"Great course, like the way of teaching. Really starts from noting and goes to a senior level of knowledge.",5
540,"Very good material, explainations and teachers. Recommended for everyone who wants to learn.",5
541,Im loving it so far.,5
542,"Very good course, still in the beginning, but liking so much.",5
543,Excellent course and well designed. Even though some of the concepts where harder for me to understand I now have a basic understanding of the structure of the abdomen.,5
544,Nice and necessary course.,5
545,Me gusto mucho,5
546,me gusto mucho,5
547,chevere,5
548,"I loved it, was very funny and relaxing.",5
549,"EXCELENTE CURSO.GRANDES TUTORASEXCELENTE METODOLOGIA DE ENSEÑANZA Y APRENDIZAJE.SE ABORDARON LOS TEMAS DE MANERA ENTENDIBLE, COMPRENSIBLE Y CON RETOS QUE INVITAN A RAZONAR Y APLICAR LOS CONOCIMIENTOS ADQUIRIDOS.ESPERO PIENSEN ELABORAR UNA SEGUNDA ETAPA DE INTERMEDIA Y AVANZADA",5
550,So far the course is just a tutorial for using Scratch and they're not teaching how to program that is the name of the course.,2
551,Muy buen curso para aprender Scratch.,5
552,Very wonderful course to learn the basics of programming using the amusing and interactive language Scratch,5
553,"A course offering very accessible, clear introduction to the concept of programming seen as a network of algorithms, supplanted with a myriad of real-life examples. It then introduced a comely intuitive software, developed by MIT - Scratch, which enables you to practically start creating animations and thus programming. Even though i'm not a fluent hispano-hablante, just the knowledge of English and some classical culture should make it possible for you to follow. At the same time, should that be too complicated, there should be subtitles/English language version to all the videos and of all other materials. Have NOT tried that though.",4
554,Very easy and good explanations,5
555,cool,5
556,"The male Professors seem to speak Chinese half the time, therefore not being able to understand the material for students who aren't fluent in Chinese. I prefer the female Professor from Advanced Neurobiology I who presented the material in English, and in an engaging and coherent way.",2
557,"The topics are really interesting and advanced! However, there's a lot of talk in chinese, due to questions/answers from teacher and students, and the quizzes are a bit too easy. I learned a lot though.",3
558,"If you don't speak Chinese it's a terrible course...The lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained (at least the first week). The transcriptions into English are incomplete, so understand this course is very very complicated.I do not recommend it at all.",1
559,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!Really Advanced course with many many resources!,5
560,This course teaches us tips of effective and constructive way of discussing !,5
561,I like the way it's presented.,5
562,Great course and very great exercises,5
563,Great Course... Although I feel we must discuss more case studies,5

602,I am very excited that I have been able to successfully complete my first Specialization.Great course!,5
603,I like all these courses,5
604,The research needs like six months,4
605,"It was an excellent challenge that tested all my previous skill acquire along the specialization. I really enjoyed myself with this course. Give it a chance and do your best. Certainly, you will succeed.Cheers!",5
606,"The course content is great, but peer evaluation is simply useless and almost random. This specialisation needs to introduce an actual final assessment by an actual expert, not peers.",2
607,Writing research paper is one of the most useful courses for all professionals.,5
608,I have learned so very much. All of the courses in the specialization have been taught in a way that has been easy to understand. I will miss Tamy Chapmans smiling face.,5
609,"I would love to thank you for your hard working. It was a good course. I have learnt a lot from you. In addition, I'm looking forward to participating with you on another course. Thank you once more again.",5
610,It is a great moment in my academic experience. Thank you Prof Tamy.,5
611,Excellent course! I'm grateful to all who made it possible.,5
612,"Jefferson is a fascinating, controversial, brilliant, and hugely important figure - unquestionably a ""Founding Father"", if you will - in our nation's history. Professor Onuf brings to light the key aspects of Jefferson's thinking, work and accomplishments, prompting this course participant to want to further explore all that he did, the challenges, and especially the people, who he was up against, his relationship with Sally Hemings and how that influenced his views regarding slavery, and much more.",4
613,"Really insightful course giving a really amazing insight to the past political climate of the US, but also really shedding light on the current climate as well.",5
614,"I very much enjoyed learning more about Thomas Jefferson through the required readings and Professor Onuf's lectures, and would recommend this course to anyone wanting to know more about the third president of the United States and the University of Virginia. My time was well-spent.",5
615,"Excellent class! This is an overview of who Jefferson was, what he really thought and believed in, what his contradictions were and why they existed, and how the perception of him has changed through different historical periods. I thought I knew a reasonable amount of information about Jefferson and the revolutionary period, but I learned so much about the historical and cultural context of the time and how it shaped Jefferson's thoughts!Given our current judicial system's split over whether the constitution should be regarded according to the 'originalist' intention or whether it is a living document, I was surprised to find that Jefferson himself saw it as a living document, to be reshaped by each generation. Understanding why he thought that is really essential to understanding how to think about the problem today. So this isn't just history, it's current events!I was concerned that the course seemed to be all lecture, but by the second week I was hooked. Dr Onuf is a compelling speaker, and tries to convey who Jefferson was, the world he existed in, and get you to think about Jefferson in all his complexity. The reading material is all pertinent, and (thank you!) not overwhelming. This course is ""right-sized"" for an online forum. I think you could spend about an our or maybe two per week on the lectures and reading material, and do fine. You would do yourself a favor to view each lecture twice though, as there is a lot of material in each one.I would consider retaking the course for review, and would definitely take another course from Dr. Onuf. This was terrific, and I don't say that lightly.",5
616,"Exciting presentation. Excellent portrial of the periodic changes in thinking of TJ with his rise, fall and revival. While a conroversial thinker he truly was a renaissance men that will inspire future generations. America would not be exceptional, nor even a free country, empowed by the people.",5
617,"My only recommendation would be to add more photos, maps, illustrations, etc to the lectures, instead of twenty minutes of the camera pointed at the professor. It would help keep the attention of the viewer, in my opinion.",4
618,The course is really nicely done. Also for non-americans it is interesting even though a lot of background knowledge might be missing. But you have to be aware it is really more focused on the ideas of Jefferson and less on all the discussions and fights he had with his fellow statesmen at that time. I would have wished to learn also more about those.,4
619,"Great Course! A profound analysis of Jefferson ideal and wish for the nation to be. This course demonstrate how great, clever and wise Jefferson was. Now I can better understand what JFK said during a Nobel prize winner reunion at the White House: This is the highest concentration of intelligent in this house since Jefferson had dinner alone. Thank you for sharing this course on the net.",5
620,"Excellent course! I learned so much about Jefferson, and I appreciate Dr. Onuf's expertise on the subject.",5
621,Great lecture series on Jefferson's civic thoughts and writings.,5
622,The lectures are so thought-provoking and enlightening... Thank you very much!,5
623,Fantastic course by Dr. Onuf! I learned much and he helped correct misconceptions I harbored regarding Thomas Jefferson. Great videos and selected readings. The quizzes were relatively challenging.,5
624,Very Thankful for this course...,5
625,I loved the tour of the campus. It fit the material and made it seem more like a college setting than watching lectures on a screen in a class room all the time.,4
626,This is everything a Coursera course should be! Amazing videos and lectures that are well organized.,5
627,"I already love this and not just because Jefferson is my life long love affair, nice.",5
628,"Really interesting to get such a deep perspective on Jefferson. I had very little interest in him, even growing up in his home state of Virginia, but now I can't wait to learn more. This is a great course worth a fantastic instructor. Highly recommended!",5
629,I take my hat off for the passionate professor Onuf. It was a big pleasure to attend his lectures. They deepened my understanding of the American Revolution.,5
630,"I was terribly disappointed in this course. Mr. Onuf spends the majority of these lectures implying what Jefferson thinks without discussing much in the way of actual history. Further, the course seems more of a commercial for the University of Virginia than anything else. Overall, a waste of time.",1
631,Great course,5
632,Fantastic stuff for anyone interesting in the subject matter.,5
633,I found the course interesting and very stimulating. It allowed insight into a very interesting period in world history.,5
634,outstanding prof,5
635,Exceptional course! I would have enjoyed several more weeks. Dr. Onuf's style and methods in presenting the material made it possible to understand Jefferson in a way I have not understood him before. Wonderful teacher. Thank you.,5
636,Really interesting and enjoyable course.,5
637,Outstanding overview of one of the most important figures in American History.,5
638,"A very enjoyable course, albeit with a few instances of leftward political leaning.",4
639,very informative,5
640,"As a former student of UVA, it was wonderful to see the place again, listen to some of the stories we heard around ""grounds"" -- no campus here -- back when I was a teenager. I have followed Jefferson's life story, but Professor Onuf still manages to tell me some things I didn't know. Well researched lectures.",5
641,"Being Australian, I knew nothing about Jefferson so I came to this course with no expectations. I found it fascinating as it explained not only about Jefferson but about the American model of Government and Americans unique view of their nation. It is sometimes puzzling to an outsider to see this super nationalism and allegiance to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. As an aside, I wonder what Jefferson would think of the apparent obsession with the literal words of the Founding Fathers with respect to things like gun control. Very interesting indeed.Mr Onuf is an excellent lecturer. You brought the topic aliveThanks",5
642,Great Course,5
643,I knew nothing about Jefferson before this course and nothing about his 'age' - not sure I am much the wiser about the latter after it! I enjoyed the tours round the historic sites and I thought the lecturer came over as warm and enthusiastic but it seemed he was preaching about a saint rather than giving a detached academic assessment of a historical figure and I found that it was hard to see the wood for the trees at times. Hagiographic might be an unkind description but it was certainly very respectful to the great man. I also liked the use of a student in cooperation with the lecturer.- he set the scene well and was a good interviewer.,3
644,The lectures are just videos of the professor bloviating about Jefferson. There is nothing academic about this course.,1
645,Useful orientation for a good American who more or less slept through all of his American hx courses in his callow youth. I have a much better sense of the important (if controversal) role Jefferson played in forming the values and structure of the US.,4
646,I highly recommend this course. I learned a great deal about Jefferson.,5
647,"Great, thanks!",5
648,"Great course that take you nicely through the intricacies of agile planning for software products. The instructors are knowledgeable and the material is good. The videos cover a lot, but the complementary cours notes and the supplemental resources makes it easy to review and use the material in practice during actual work situations.",5
649,"Lots of well structured content, easy to follow and informative. You know it's the tip of a large iceberg, so it's a very good way to start and let you wanting for more.",4
650,This course gets better as you move into the course!,5
651,"Great Course, Learnt alot of extremely useful tools for managing software products.",5
652,Good for learning to plan software product development using Agile,5
653,Very interestening for starting in Agility. I learned and understood a lot of things.Easy to understand for not English mother tongue.Thank you very much.,5
654,great class,5
655,Good Planning methodologies and examples,5
656,"Really learning alot, well explained and illustrated.",5
657,Really like this course! I think it is the best one in this specialization. Thank you all!,5
658,"Tons of great info! However, it would great to go over more of the real-life applications of the concepts.",5
659,Great course,5
660,That course is great! All material is described in easy form. I like very my tasks that had to be done and then put marks by other students.,5
661,It is very full package of knowledge and tests. I have a lot of new opportunities due to this course. Thank you.,5
662,It is excellent course in terms of the knowledge that I gain. However the multiple choice questions are a little bit default to understand. It is look like that you are examining our English skill :),4
663,"Really helpful course! Thanks, Coursera!",5
664,It is great learning experience..,5
665,79 USD? just to be able to submit peer-graded assignments... talk about greed,1
666,This course has helped me increase my knowledge and skills in project planning using Agile.,5
667,Pretty good.. A bit tough compared to the rest though.,5
668,As usual for this specs - a very high quality course.,5
669,"Great examples used in course videos. The Course Notes might be a worked on a bit more in terms of models and examples, but they are quite extensive and an invaluable resource. Teaching staff is quick to respond to forum questions, which is great!",4
670,"Quite interesting, may be not deep enough but great course nevertheless!",5
671,Full of new information on agile planning!,5
672,great course,4
673,"The most robust course in this sequence. It is well designed, very clear, teaches useful material effectively, and is fun to take.",5
674,Very easy to understand.,5
675,I think some estimation methods are not really realistic,4
676,It's a great course,5
677,Another great course in the specialization! great instructors who are very passionate. Truly make it fun and interesting to learn.,5
678,Great course,5
679,"My least favorite part of the course, but it was still put together well. Content just isn't as interesting as the rest of the specialization. Felt a bit too ""Project Manager' instead of the Product Manager.",4
680,It's very usefull course,4
681,Was great course.,5
682,Great course! Very useful information for beginners and for those who already has an experience with agile planning.,5
683,"Some part of learning material not concern to agile planning, for exampe absolutly not mentioned kanban planing.",4
684,This is a good series course to coach Agile process with generic pro,5
685,Really enjoyed t,5
686,Makes lots of things understandable and clear,5
687,Good Course.,4
688,"One of the best coursers I have seen on Coursera so far. The video production quality, course structure and content is extra ordinary compared to other courses that I've seen so far.",5
689,Very nice content and presented so nicely. Must read and highly recommended course for all managers and business analysts.,5
690,"I am Krishna Kant Kumar, working as a software quality analyst.Through this course, I learnt, how to estimate an iteration or doing an estimation of project.",4
691,Ambiguous assignments led to cumbersome completion. The peer grading got a little annoying as sometimes it took forever to get feedback and a lot of times feedback was minimal or the criteria for grading was vague and people took it WAY too seriously.,3
692,"Not the best, but if you are a newbie in management field you can find valuable information inside.",4
693,I highly recommend this entire specialisation. It's clearly taught and requires your practical application throughout. I've learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed the process. Many many thanks Uni of Alberta.,5
694,Room for improvement:-Case studies-More Assignment,4
695,Thanks!,5
696,"As a software-engineer and freelancer in the technical software domain, for me this course actually had all the meat (so far) while the first courses in the specialization felt like they didn't take that much effort to pass.",5
697,"Very useful to know different tecniques for software project/productplanning. Although some of those tecniques are (in my opinion) notvery relevant in an Agile environment (like work breakdown structures,pert or gant charts) the course is good to learn how to use those toolsand also to ask ourselves whether or not they are actually relevant or useful if we follow the Agile approach.",4
698,I really liked to do it,5
699,The course materials and lectures are excellent,5
700,"Really nice course. I was expecting a little more depth, but I really enjoyed the approach they took and their assignments.",4
701,Awesome lectures! Thanks a lot!,5
702,Great course! Thank you!,5
703,"Super-duper, very useful!",5
704,"This course has the minimal information than its brother courses, you may need to add more details focus on the planning more and give more assignment if applicable.",4
705,Another excellent module of a truly excellent Specialization,5
706,Good Course,5
707,Nice course. Decent content and always well-structured lectures. The peer assignments could have been better though.,4
708,This is more enlightening than the previous courses in the specialization. It felt like learning new material and techniques rather than simply reviewing concepts I already knew. I also liked that the assignments required creating actual artifacts and reviewing others' work. The industry interviews were a nice addition as well.,5
709,Really excited about the course..!!!,5
710,"Very tough, though very instructive.",3
711,I think ti is a very interesting and well structured course.,5
712,"I am participating in this course, it has an excellent material, I am learning new skills in writing an article research.",5
713,Very interesting course,5
714,"The course has enhanced my reading experience. Writing in the margins… up till now I have never challenged or asked the writer any questions. This idea has never struck me before, but interacting with texts provides ""room"" on the page for my conversation with the writer, which is a visual reminder that all texts are part of an ongoing discussion and are not the last word on a given subject.Thank you, Prof. Bazanova!",5
715,It's a very interesting and useful course. It significantly improves my reading and writting skills. Thank you very much!,5
716,"interesting, informative and useful. I quite like the self-questioning part which makes publication reading more effortless. Thanks.",5
717,It's a both very interesting and useful course for everyone who's planning to broaden the skills of a scentific writings in a quite involving and systematic manner.,5
718,Very interesting and useful course!,5
719,Thank you for your course. I improved my academic literacy skills. I still have to continue to improve but now I'm on the right track!,5
720,"The course is excellent! Straight to the point, both professors can explain the subject in a very easy way. The course was a pleasant surprise!! I strongly recommend!",5
721,Looking forward to course 3!,5
722,"Excellent course with very supportive staff and professors on the forum. On top of that aligning the assignments to ""The Romance of Three Kingdoms"" story makes it fun to follow along.",5
723,Very good course and excelent teachers!,5
724,Fantastic course material from great professionals!,5
725,"Really useful, focused and motivating. Hihgly recommended!",5
726,Was a really good course which provided me useful knowledge for my postgraduate course.,5
727,"Excellent, educational and witty lectures! One of the best classes on Coursera.",5
728,I like Prof. Tobias Kretschmer way to communicate the course and explain the contents in practical and well organized way. The course is very useful for my work.,4
729,Great Course and the professor is great!,5
730,I love this dude; very entertaining professor who is easy to understand. The class itself was also very interesting and i learned a lot that i can apply to my current position as a senior analyst at an industry research firm.,5
731,"Easy to follow, good content and comprehensive explanations",5
732,Course and examples are generally good. In rare instances the quiz has answers it labells 'correct' which I think could be debated.,4
733,Interesting course. Valuable insights into network effects.,4
734,"Excellent course, an excellent professor!!!!, Many thanks!!!",5
735,A nice course for the opics concluded from the base course.,5
736,THANK YOU!,5
737,"Excellent course, professor tobias teachs so good!",5
738,"The course was really great! The teacher explained excellent and the topics were very appropiate. However, when i finished the course i couldn't see the certificate of accomplishment at least; it never showed up :( And now when i click on the option ""Buy the course"" the page redirects me to an address which doesn't exist.Despite of this, I enjoyed this course a lot, as the first one! Thanks a lot!",3
739,Terrific course! Terrific instructor! I wish he had provided a learning path for ppl who completed this though...,5
740,Very interesting and full of real case study.,4
741,Great add-on to the first eddition of the course on Business Strategy. Congratulations to the Professor Tobias and his crew.,5
742,This is one of the best courses. The manner of teaching is very lucid and easy to understand. I am impressed with the examples. I would love to have more courses from him on Competitive Strategy!! Cheers!,5
743,"It's the best course, on which I have ever been enrolled. Its language is understandable not only for students of economic departments and for everyone, who is interested in this topic. The professor is a professional in his sphere and just a talented person with an actor's skills. He turned the course into an interesting tour of Munich, because every module is connected with some sight of the city, this activates attention and makes teaching material more remembered. If this course is continued, I will definitely join it! Thank you)",5
744,Exceptional training course for those working in the field of market strategy etc. Explanation and examples are close to the actual world.,5
745,The best free strategy course!,5
746,Awesome lecture. I wish the lectures at my University would have been as good as this. Then I think I would have a much better and more interesting time and I`d learned a lot more.Thanks for all your work!!Best wishes form Switzerland!,5
747,nice one to get into the strategy of any kind of the competionsyou could pass it even if you didn't go through the Part1anyhow it will be more then useful to understand the basis,4
748,excellent and some hint of humour in an otherwise rather arid topic!thanks,5
749,This a great course. I recommend it to anyone. Also make sure to take the previous course. The exams are great way to fixate knowledge.,5
750,"One of the best online course i have ever taken, i seriously reccomend this course to all those people who are into business and management.",5
751,"Very informative with plenty of real-life (or credible fictional) examples to better understand the concepts that were introduced. The pace was agreeable and the subjects diverse. Special mention should go to the instructor (Prof. Tobias Kretschmer), who did a terrific job! I liked the question format as well, though it could have been more challenging by not giving away the answers after an end-of-module quiz even if you didn't pass. That being said, the course is well worth 5 stars!",5
752,"Actually, the course should be titled as ""Introduction Into Macroeconomics"", I think. The course is fine, but I won't call it really ""advanced"" one. The structure and topic list is okay, but the depth is not enough to threat the course as ""advanced"".",3
753,Absolutely useful! They make it so easy to understand and probably the best MOOC I´d ever apply for,5
754,Just love it,5
755,Love your style of teaching. The Multiple choice answers in your exams are difficult but necessary to fully understand the topics.Content of the course - 100/100.I would take another course of Prof. Kretschmer instantly.,5
756,Well structured course! The explanation was clear and I have the frame works in my mind when I finish the course! Helpful course!,5
757,"Honestly, for something that says ""Advanced"" in the title, I thought it was a little too basic. There isn't enough depth and a lot of it involves common sense. Perhaps a more case-study driven course would have been interesting with more qualitative, essay responses required rather than cut-and-dry multiple-choice.",3
758,"content was not as interesting as in the first course, but still good overall. Questions were also less analytical challenging as the first course. But I still enjoyed the course as the professor was explaining the subject clearly and the videos were compact and enjoyable.",4
759,"Overall, this is a good subject.However, some slides are not well organized.Many questions in assignment are too tricky.",3
760,Fascinating material. Thanks again!,4
761,"Great professor, interesting course.",5
762,"while the task of summing up a lot of information in a minimum sized presentation is always a very difficult task, the structure of the material presented was not optimal. This in turn made it difficult for me personally to actually connect the weekly information presented with the overall meaning and the objective of each module. The ""why"" and ""how"" of most modules fit to the meaning we are forming (up to week 5 -the point I am leaving this class) is not evident. Last, some of the questions contained ambiguities that could not be reasonably clarified even going back and reviewing the material of the specific segment. Thank you for the offered class in any case.",2
763,"Varied and well-explained that held my interest throughout. My only criticism is the English in some of the written quizzes, especially in the final exam, needs reviewing by native speaker as some of the answers are ambiguous when they do not properly explain the context of the situation.",4
764,One of the best courses on Coursera.,5
765,Awesome course! I learned a lot through this journey. Thanks very much for providing this course.,5
766,Amazing course.,5
767,"Good course, Hope we had a certification for this.",5
768,"One suggestion would be lest multiple option answers, but the course was challenging enough to learn valuable information.",4
769,Very useful course and extremely well presented. Would recommend it.,4
770,World-class,5
771,"Very good course, but it is not ""advanced strategy"".",4
772,Very informative and I learned a lot,4
773,Valuable sequel to course Competitive Strategy by the same author. Interesting and informative.,5
774,"it is well put and easy to understand. besides, you can learn it anytime. the content is enlightening and has many new and intestesting topics. i really like it .",5
775,"This course is not only well structured, but truly enjoyable with the various outdoor background",5
776,"It was a great course, however some of the quiz answers are debatable",4
777,"After completing this course, I have gained valuable insights in real life situations and be more aware in my own industry. This course would not only allow you to see the playing field but also to make carefully calculated decisions towards the best possible outcome.The tests are difficult and some are rather tricky. But hey, the situations we encounter in real life are far worse than these.",5
778,"Material was tough, some of the questions weren't easy to understand / process. But overall a great class.",4
779,Very Good!,5
780,"While the course was overall well developed, there are certain language challenges to overcome especially with understanding the wording of quizzes. I got a number of questions wrong simply because I could not understand the phrasing, and lack of explanations on quizzes makes for a lot of difficulty to evaluate progress. And I get the reason for not including answer explanations, at the same time I'm literally comparing answers to the module transcripts and could not possibly infer multiple choice answers based off how the topic was explained. I would suggest more definitive questions and reduce multiple choice questions or at least define the question in a more narrow, specified manner to minimize confusion. I'm taking this course for fun, I have an MBA and love strategy, so the topics are not new by any means, but if I can't understand what you're trying to say I would imagine non-business backgrounds would find the questions very difficult.",4
781,it was great learning such interesting issues,5
782,"Nice addition to the ""Competitive Strategy"" course, although not as interesting and practical as the first part... Cases and current examples would have made this section much better.Prof. Tobias Kretschmer ... 5 starsCompetitive Strategy . . . 5 starsAdvanced Competitive Strategy ... 3 stars",3
783,An easy to understand and very resourceful course with ample examples. Would love to enroll into similar courses.,5
784,Awesome concept to learn,5
785,very Insightful,4
786,"It's a very good course, with fabolous material, examples and style",5
787,5 stars! Great University !! Enjoyed and learned!,5
788,Perfect professor!,5

804,The perfect brainstorming exercise for academic essay writing !,5
805,"It helps you build your essay-writing muscles gradually. Too much emphasis on plagiarism. Some flaws in the grading forms. The level of the participants is quite mixed, most feedback they give is useless (""good"").",2

813,I found it very useful,5
814,Exellent course. You will learn the advanced skills for a better understanding of the English languaje.,5
815,This course is awesome.,5
816,"The course is fine as far as content. My complaint is that there is no one to contact regarding papers or questions. You are left to the other students for your grading and assignment completion, meaning that some of your assignments can hang there for weeks before ever getting reviewed.",3
817,very useful course.,5
818,An absolutely wonderful course! I learned a lot about advanced essay writing. I think it is a must-take course for those who are interested in writing academic and research essays!,5
819,Not the course id think it would be.I learn less information than i d expect but these were still usefull information.,3
820,Loved it!,5
821,well explained informative course,4
822,This course helped me improve my writing skills.,5
823,Great course :),5
824,This course has set me free from my fear of expressing my ideas and opinions in writing.,5
825,Great course,5
826,I have learned a lot in this course. Ordinary English courses don't cover the topics we have studied here.,5
827,Great !!!!,5
828,"This was a great class for review of what I learned years ago. I only wish I could have participated in the assignments w/o purchasing the class, as I have been able to in all of my other classes. But, I loved the class and would recommend it.",4
829,"Fantastic! Good work that the teacher can compact the course section to less than 10-minute videos each week, and it is clear. Easy to grasp . . . help a lot for my initial study! MLA format and work cited page are great too . . . thanks!",4
830,It was really useful. From now on I will start applying everything I've learn in my collage tasks.,4

838,"great, thank you :)",5
839,Perfect,5
840,"It has good content, but there were missing classes to give more advices or clear any question students have, when grading peer review homeworks there were plenty of mistakes that would have been avoided if there were more video lectures or forums with teachers.",3
841,"From this 1.5 month course, I learned far more than I did from the 4-year on-campus studying. Of course, the level of the universities in my country is not nearly as that of the US; nevertheless, in the single combat ""Adv.Writing course against a ""Bachelor's degree"", the latter sustains a crushing defeat!",5
842,Advanced Writing is a course that challenges the best English learner. You apply what you've learned so far and things get more formal.,5
843,This course has a lot of tools to learn the writing art.,5
844,through this course i was able to right effectively on some complex topics which was what i was hoping for. Thanks a lot to the instructor Tamy Chapman whose video lectures were excellent in content and quality.,5
845,"I wasn't sure what to expect with the Advanced Writing course. Again, peer review was unnecessarily harsh because people don't understand the flexibility and nuance of writing, but it's definitely informative and has made me a more mature academic writer. This specialization is well worth it, for the videos alone. The instructor is clear and the videos are very concise.",3
846,It would be extremely useful to me as it is teaching me techniques to write advanced-level essays.,4
847,"It is detailed, rigorous, and exciting! The teacher's presentations in video materials are interesting as well!",5
848,great course thnx,4
849,Wonderful course!,5
850,I have learnt so much for doing this course. I have recommended the course to friends and families.,4
851,so good. must be engaged,5
852,It is so beneficial for international students who have been prepared on TOEFL iBT or IELTS.,5

857,Another well structured course that provided challenges to help impove essay writing techniques. Thanks you.,5
858,"It is not very ""advanced""",2
859,"At this point, I think that the course is good, however there should be more reviews. Three reviews of people who is also learning is not enough, in my opinion. I have received some comments like 'some sentences are not good'. Which tells me absolutely nothing. I think people should be encouraged to exemplify what they mean ,to take the sentences that they believe that are wrong, and extend why.For the rest, the course is very good.",4
860,helped in my phd writing thesis,5
861,"I am in love for this course, a lot of good information, practice activities, etc...It is helping me a lot!",5
862,nice things to do and good examples.,4
863,Fantastic and fun!,5
864,This advanced writing course illustrates how to writing a longer college essay and guides students all over the world to start their very first writing piece.,5
865,"Extremely poor quality of instruction. The lectures themselves are little more than the material being read directly off the slides by an individual with a poor grasp on the English language. The majority of the slides are walls of unclear and non-descriptive text. Even with reading directly from the slides, the lecturer is overly circumstantial in her explanations if not just outright tangential. I commend the authors for putting together a course outside of their native language but, in this case at least, it does more harm than good.In short, this course has the air of a group of first year students giving a presentation verbatim from the slides, as another commenter also mentioned below.",1
866,"This course is a discreditation to coursera, and it's low standards are appalling. From a purely certificate based perspective, the only requirement to complete the course are completely the quizzes. They are short, and can easily be googled, or the slides can be downloaded and the answers simply CRTL+F for keyboards. There is zero need to watch the lectures ( at least for the first 2 weeks).The lectures are terrible themselves. The English is beyond horrible, and I don't understand the modern culture of having teachers teach in languages they can't speak. It is purely reading off the slides in any case, word for word. I learned more about the basics in neuroscience in a 20 minutes lecture from a separate course, ""Computational Neuroscience"" than the entire first week here.If you actually want to learn neuroscience, check out HardvardX's intro course.",1
867,easily understood,5
868,"This is the worst, most pathetic course I have taken online. If Peking University believes this is their best - I'll not be taking another course with them. The instructor's command of the English language is awful and the sub-titles are some help, but not a lot. Instructors are just talking faces up front - they cannot teach. They may be great in the lab, but keep them out of the classroom. I toughed out the course, but it only got worse. I had originally signed up for parts 1 and 2 of this course. Canceled part 2. The use of slides that are not clear / too small and not on the screen long enough to digest the information did not help. Do yourself a favor - avoid this course. As a side note - I have taken in excess of 25 online courses, this was the most painful.",1
869,Very good Course!! Thank You.,4
870,Very boring... The professor is just reading (with a bad English). The illustrations are also very boring...,1
871,The professor is reading long texts. It is not really attractive.,2
872,"I greatly enjoyed the material presented in this course and while I do not doubt the proficiency of it's creators the poor standard of spoken English of its two main presenters prevents me from recommending it to colleagues. As another reviewer has remarked, their English may be quite sufficient for day to day use with other experts but for inadequate for teaching students who are hearing many technical terms for the first time. The transcripts are no better and also contain many mistakes. I believe that this course should be stopped until these problems are corrected.",2
873,"Very excellent course, I learned a lot. It lets me know the development process of the neuro-science and also the heros in it. My major is alternative splicing, I wish other life science branches can have this kinds of course too.",5
874,"The professors sound like a group of first-year students presenting a group project, literally reading notes off of a powerpoint slide. The professors also can't speak English, so instead of explaining things in depth, they have to very, very slowly read basic phrases (to explain complex subject matter) off of what's basically a teleprompter.",1
875,"The course presented a lot of interesting, fascinating information. I especially liked the first female lecturer. However, there were some problems with downloading the course slide presentations and questions were never answered in the forum discussion groups. In addition, the second lecturer, although very interesting, often did not talk about the material that was presented on exams. I also think integrating a lot more animation to describe different processes would be effective so that students can visualise the content.",4
876,Dr. Li is a wonderful teacher! I love his style very much!,5
877,Accurate and clear.,5
878,thank you for opening ideas in the world of neurobiology I have learned a lot so far and I'm sure I will learn much more with you ..greetings from Guayaquil-Ecuador,5
879,"So far the topics are very interesting but the accent of the teacher is sooo difficult to follow and distracts me! Also, she is looking down to read all the time and this doesn't reflect her knowledge.",3
880,"Really poor powerpoint presentations and videos, half in chinese. The accent of the teacher is horrible (i'm not an english-native speaking person so it's hard for me to follow english when badly spoken, so i cut off the sound and only read the subtitles.)The content is interesting though.",1
881,"Is a good course, with a comprenhensible material and resourses. I think they should improve the quility of video-classes and some teachers doesn´t have good english pronunciation.",5
882,Fascinating course but a little too much math for my taste.,4
883,"I don't want to be mean, but the first week was terrible! I was expecting what it said: ADVANCED neurobiology.I feel bad giving this review. I'm just dropping the course.",1
884,"After finishing week 1, I have decided to stick with Duke university's Medical neuroscience which is starting up again. I also highly recommend ""Understanding the Brain The Neurobiology of Everyday Life"" which I believe was taught by the University of Chicago. I found them to be far more engaging the viewer and the format to be much easier to follow. I found it visually disturbing and also have to keep pausing to read the slide before it switches.It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this course. It also seemed she had trouble pronouncing many of the words and I do not want to learn how to pronounce many of them incorrectly also many of the slides did not have an English translation on them.",1
885,Great course! I loved the teachers!,5
886,"I find this to be a very nice and stimulating course. The teachers are enthusiastic and entertaining. The course material (slides, quizzes, captions) needs to be polished, but the general organization of the course is logical, clear, and systematic. The course presents an experimentalist's view of the subject, which I find very good considering that much related Coursera material is quite theoretical. There are plenty of historical notes and introductions of general neurobiology research viewpoints (don't miss the excellent bonus material interviews!). In particular, I enjoyed the ""cherry picking"" metaphor. Some students have had problems with the instructors' accent, but perhaps because English is not my first language, this has not been a problem for me at all. I'm looking forward to part two of the course!",4
887,"This course is useless and perhaps even harmful.The professors would have done much better if they had taught the class in their native Chinese language and then got a really good translator to make subtitles in English.I tried turning off the sound and just watching the presentation while reading the subtitles, but even this was so badly done in terms of language and presentation, that although I desperately wanted to take a course in advanced neurobiology, I felt that this course could actually destroy my love for the subject or teach me things that are incorrect because of language mistakes.If you are not a native speaker of English then by all means steer even further clear as you will learn some very bad English habits and pronunciation.I'm sure the profs' English ability is fine for collaborating with other professionals who already know the material, but teaching in English was a big mistake.Again, I highly suggest they re-do the entire thing in Chinese and get really good translations and subtitles made and then I think it could be an awesome course. Now, as is, it would be truly foolish to take this course.",1
888,Boring and can't make sense of the presentation / language and idiom use.,2
889,"before discussing genetic mutations occurred in Alzheimer disease that mentioned when discussing AIS, i think some refreshment about protein synthesis and the normal pattern that if disturbed by certain ways as mutations causes particular diseases.some arrangements of material needed to prevent information overlappinginteresting courses, go onthanks for your efforts dear professors",3
890,"Lots of good information, but the presentation is very bad. Not only are the professors clearly struggling with the English (and the material, calling anatomical planes ""plates"" and confounding sulci with fissures, etc), but some of the recording/video editing decisions make it less engaging and more difficult to follow. For example, the size of the images is often compromised because they chose to show the professor on the left side of the screen, even though it is absolutely unnecessary to do so.Overall, I do not recommend this course.",1
891,"Great course, much to learn in a short time but with an excellent guide.",5
892,Me gusto,5

895,"coursea does not allow me to quit the class. Also, I cannot do the homework or watch video at my own pace.",1
896,"Great class, very well constructed. Professors are very knowledgeable and the course materials are well designed. I started from the very beginning of the class knowing very little about python and algorithm, by this class I'm pretty comfortable coding in python. And I got to apply what I've learned in my interview for jobs. Definitely a great class! Learned a lot, and still applying it in my job.",5
897,"Compared to the previous courses in this specialization I found this a tough course. Calculating the big-O for yourself wasn't easy. The descriptions of the applications #1 and #2 were not very clear to me at the start (probably because English is not my first language). Some sentences I had to read several times before I understand what was asked. But the things I learned are useful and I am definitely sure that what I have learned here I can use in my work as software engineer. Thank you Luay, Scott and Joe for another excellent course.",5
898,"Too much bla, bla, bla. Very slowly, very boring.",3
899,A course I enjoy very much!,5
900,"The applications were too time consuming. Please consider adding a tool that makes graphing easier. The course itself was very good and engaging and without us knowing it, would teach core fundamentals of computing through the coding exercises.",4
901,"It takes some serious dedication to understand and apply the material if math and computation are foreign to you, like they were for me. But if you apply that dedication, the material is accessible and the feeling of accomplishment is tremendous. Great class/teaching.",5

905,"The transition from the original Coursera platform to the new one has significantly reduced my overall satisfaction with the course experience (I have previously taken the 4 earlier Rice courses in this series and enjoyed them immensely).Major contributing factors to my dissatisfaction:-- The user interface changes are unwelcome and have detracted from my ability to engage with the material.-- There have been arbitrary (and unannounced) changes to polices, e.g. dropping distinction grading.-- The price increase per course and locking down of assignments to only those who have paid has unfortunate side effects, including.-- In contrast to previous courses in this series which had an active community engagement the discussion forums are now relatively empty, running the courses more often is not going to help this situation.Having previously been an unpaid evangelist for the Coursera approach and materials I now find myself extremely reluctant to recommend this revised experience to colleagues.",1
906,"I found the material of this course to be very enlightening, it's not too difficult if you have the appropriate background. However, it will take a decent amount of time to fully complete. As part of the specialization, all of the skills I've learned were consolidated and put to an interesting use with this class.",4
907,"The lectures will not get you near the understanding you'll need to complete the assignments. though the resources will.The application is great, and hard so you'll actually have to understand the material.You have been warned, this course is very different to the other courses in the specialization!",4

The pace is good - each module covers just enough before moving on to the next topic, so it's engaging without being overwhelming. There's a good range of discussions, from economic theory, practical case studies and interviews with farmers. It builds on what I've learned elsewhere, so will be useful for real-world application.",5

930,A good and relevant course,5
931,Very rewarding and insightfull learned a ton !,5
932,i like this course very much,5
933,Provides a nice basis in understanding how economic principles are used to investigate agriculture production. Could provide a bit more of an economic foundation but the course is broad rather than deep.,3
934,It was an amazing experience. I learned so much. Thank you :),5
935,"It's really about economics in its broader meaning: how different natural, social, and financial aspects play together to set present and future of farmers and the communities they live in.I highly recommend this course to anyone, even if not specifically interested in agriculture economics.",5
936,"I am much excited to partake in this course and it has really improved my worth. i strongly recommend it everyone. A very big THANK YOU to the coursera team for such an initiative and also to the Agriculture faculty of university of western of western Australia for such a partnership. i am very grateful, looking forward to work with you.

940,Pretty Good Course,4
941,"It's a beautiful course! Not only did I learn more (than I estimated) about economics and agriculture, there was also a nice balance between theory and practical applications. The recommended readings are relatable and reinforce the content of the videos. As a teacher, Dave is careful to present both sides of any issue (for example, he presents both gylphosate as the largest used herbicide, while maintaining that it is also very controversial). Pannell Discussions are a delight to read, since they deliver the intended content without sounding like research papers, which sometimes they may actually be based upon. It's wonderful to see such researchers having the patience to blog about such issues online! At a more subtle level, things like the location choices (farms for the agricultural weeks and buildings for institutional/policy weeks), altering background music - all made enriched my experience!Ofcourse, I think I will still have to brush up my concepts from time to time (since an online course can not replace internalization of a subject through rigorous comprehension and examination), and ofcourse I have quite a lot more to ""learn"" in this area (who doesn't? :P).But the course was a very informative, balanced and highly interesting introduction for me!",5
942,A great short course delivered by one of the best agricultural economist in the world with a great publication history,5
943,The course was amazing i learned a lot of new things . if someone responding to these review i want to add something . In final quiz i did not find proper result . Which question i marked wrong and which one right . So please solve this problem.,4
944,Great Course have already learned so much. And still hoping to learn more.,5
945,"Great mental workout. Well-explained, but the coding challenges and bonus questions are challenging enough to allow for a lot of growth even for more advanced students.",5
946,As someone with only (UK) high school level maths I just about managed to follow this. I am still confused by logarithms. I guess I should go and read the maths for computer science resource.,4
947,I had a great time taking this course. It was a very good course in algorithms that explained the core concepts really well rather than just providing a high level overview. The assignments take some time but it aligns with what the instructor is teaching. The instructor is absolutely excellent because he takes the time to go through the math and iterations which helps to develop a deeper intuition for these algorithms. Looking forward to completing his other courses when I got time.,5
948,"Course is brilliant, but at least for me the completion took in average 3 times more effort than expected by authors (4-8 hrs/week). Of course this is mostly due to my low experience with programming, but still, might be relevant for other learners, who don!t have much experience.",5
949,Sometimes too much mathematics.,4
950,"It was an awesome and challenging course.And ,the lecturer Mr.Tim Roughgarden did introduced the gist that I need.So ,of course, I owe him a big thank.Thank you all.",5

956,"This course has relatively few instructions about homework. I believe more test cases would be better.(Though able to be found in forum.) Besides, lecture is really awesome. Thanks a lot.",5
957,Very good course in algorithms. I bought the book to help me understand but the lectures make it way easier and thus much more fun to understand the analysis. Looking forward to complete the spec,5
958,I like this course a lot. Going to learn everything in the specialization.,5
959,Excellent course. The statistical analysis was a little too fast and overwhelming towards the end but overall I learned a lot.,5
960,I would really love to take this course as I m currently a computer science and thanks for granting me this course Yuhuuuuu!,4
961,it is very important to learn algorithms as it is truly said it is heart of computer programming .. I am very happy and thanks for offering such a course to coursera and have just started hope will learn something so that it will help !!!!,5

963,Great course but audio and video are terribly out of sync.,4
964,"The course was pretty good. Definitely worth the money, and better than I expected from an online course. I thought it was a little heavy with probability proofs, but that's probably because I struggle with stats.",5
965,A very nice course!,5
966,"I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class, but I don't feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime. The class was challenging, but mostly for the wrong reasons. I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning. It also took me much longer than the 4-8 hours per week advertised to complete each week.",3
967,Thank you so much! I grown so much in the field of Algorithms because of this course. Onto the next one.,5
968,Liked the style and intensity of the course!,5
969,This is a best algorithm course I have ever done!,5
970,"The instructor for this course is absolutely excellent. He is a master of the subject and explains the material to get at the concepts behind it rather than just a superficial understanding. He also does not get lost in mathematical notation, explaining clearly what each piece of the math he is showing us means.",5
971,Very good course !,5
972,It's an amazing introduction to algorithms. I enjoyed listening to the lectures. All the algorithms were explained in detail.,5
973,The course was quite useful and enlightening！I was a good start to learn algorithms!,5
974,"Tim Roughgarden teaches with wit and depth. Speaking with idiomatic verve, he injects life into Algorithms!",5
975,A must for wannable computer geek.,5
976,The ideas from this course are fun.,5
977,"Very good review of divide and conquer algorithms, however, I only recommend for those who are willing to put in the hard work as I found it challenging.",5
978,I'm so glad that I've taken this course. This is really fantastic.,5
979,Very Useful,5
980,"This is a great course. The teacher is very clear, and the material is very interesting. The programming assignments are interesting: the problems asked are very simple, but the input is generally too large to use brute force: you really have to implement the algorithms presented in the videos. This makes you realize how much smart algorithms can make a difference.The level of the class is relatively high, compared to other Coursera courses I've taken. If you want some serious training on algorithms, look no further.",5
981,"I would recommend this course to anyone who has some experience with coding, but has not taken an algorithm course. I particularly like this course because it is more ""math-heavy"" than some of the other courses. After taking this course, you might not be able to solve all Leetcode problems (so probably will not help with your interviews directly), but from an intellectual point of view, I think the instructor does a good job explaining why people care about algorithms and how to analyze a class of algorithms rigorously.",4
982,Challenging but Insightful. Definitely worth it.,5
983,"This course offers one of the best introductions to reasoning about algorithms in a mathematical way. However, it is not just theory, it also gives you practical advise and forces you to polish up your programming skills as well by implementing some of the most useful and popular algorithms for sorting and similar applications in whatever language you wish.",5
984,"Excellent course. What I valued most about this course was the clarity with which proofs and algorithms are explained. In learning algorithms one really profits from a great professor. Keep in mind that this course involves mathematics for proofs and I believe one has to be really curious about algorithms and dive into proofs to take full advantage of this course. Regarding assignments they are challenging but definitely approachable if you have some experience in programming. My advice: do not get discouraged, this is all about resilience!",5
985,Excellent course! I would recommend it to everyone who wants to learn algorithms.,5
986,"Awesome,right now I know why algorithms are most important..!!",5
987,Tim gives great insights and draws attention to the right things at right time! Exercise and quizzes are very helpful and makes you think in right direction. Also the in-video-quizzes are well thought of to make you think about the topic being described in the video and thus makes it easy to understand the contents. This is just the right course anyone should take to improve/learn algorithm and data structures course. I've got got aaha! moments multiple times. Can't thank Tim enough!!,5
988,Sir Tim Roughgarden teaches very straight forward and easy .I like the course.,5
989,Cool class,5
990,Exceptional materials and teacher.,5
991,Great,4
992,Challenging and fun!,5
993,Amazing course!,5
994,The unique value of taking the course: read and think through the material with guidance and completing its assignments is the efficiency by saving all the search cost would I collect on my own the good and succinct presentation of the knowledge and exercises with solutions (at least correctness checks.) The entire detail of an algorithm is hard to keep afresh in memory and one needs to refresh it from time to time. It is very cost-effective to take a course like this to accelerate the refresh.,4
995,"Very good course on algorithms, a lot of terms explained in details with exercises",5
996,"Well structured, well explained. Great course!",5
997,Very nice course !!,5
998,This is a great course for who doesn't have a computer science background!,5
999,This course has some great quiz questions. I'd recommend it to people just for them.,5
1000,"The math in this course is quite difficult, but the professor does a great job of explaining it in a very easily understood way.",5
1001,very challenging fast-paced course,5
1002,I was very amazed with his really good lectures. Especially proving each algorithm's correctness and performance was very interesting and stimulated my curiosity. I also need to note that optional videos for probability helped me a lot to understand this course. I would like to recommend my friends definitely.,5
1003,"Great course to improve your skills on Algorithms, Space and Time complexities",4
1004,Professor Roughgarden makes algorithms cool. With his passion for the topic you can't help but get excited about it too. I feel like I got a deep understanding of the topics covered versus just learning a recipe to sort an array. Looking forward to more.,5
1005,Needs hands-on experience with high-school probability to help crack the exams,4
1006,Best online course and one of the best courses in programming,5
1007,It would be nice to see more examples especially were we have too many formulas. I still confused with probability.Also hadwritting isnt really helping. I am most of the time decoding scripts. In addition he is reading the formula at one moment and in around 3-4 seconds it appears on the screen. So I kind of listening him while trying to read what is happening on the screen. horrible experience.,3
1008,"Personally, I would recommend this course to anyone who really wants to learn how things work in that sort of algorithms. I found the assignments a little difficult, but also extremely helpful.",5
1009,"It´s been a long time since I had so much fun. Like going back to school. The course was great, the material is excelent, the assignements interesting and challenging. I really liked this course and am getting ready for the next one on the series.",5
1010,it was awsome!! one of the best courses and materials regarding algorithms i have taken!thanks a lot!totally worth my time and money =),5
1011,Great course with interesting assignments.,5
1012,"the tutorials is not for average students, it takes a very high skill to understand them . also the quiz nd the assignments r too tough.hope you can make them a bit easy, the last one ,ie with graphs and trees was a bouncer. If the maths required is so high, please take a week to first explain the math fresher required in course and then start the main course",1
1013,This is great course,5
1014,It's an amazing courses aiming to high-level and fast-pace algorithmic thinker.,5
1015,"I enjoyed this course, it was more challenging than the first one in the sequence, especially in the graph-search portion. The last 2 weeks are much more simple, but it is still essential for any serious student of CS to learn about data structures, especially common and practical DS such as heaps and hash tables.",5
1016,"The professor is amazing. He has the ability to present the material very clearly, concise, and with a good dose of humour! I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in algorithms and data structures as an undergraduate or a professional.",5
1017,good in depth knowedge.,3
1018,"This was another good one, providing a slightly deeper dive than I had seen in other courses. The big revelation here, for me, was the addition of Bellman-Ford algorithm for evaluating shortest path in networks (graphs) that have some negative distance values between nodes.I also like the approach to data structures (high-level, then drilling down into increasing detail for level of interest) I find it hard to say I understand a data structure based on ""Interface and Theory"" and I would have felt the certification meant more with at least a rudimentary implementation. I guess that makes me a coder at at heart.I am about to jump into the next course of the specialization: Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming As with the two courses before, I am expecting new revelations about the kind of programming issues I've been solving for more than fifteen years.",5
1019,A really good course,5
1020,Useful refresher!,5
1021,"I learned a lot lot lot, no more to say. Fantastic.",5
1022,"very good course! but I think this specialization focus on mathematical analysis, we need to practice more",5
1023,"Great course, at least for people like me who lack of computer science background.",5
1024,This course let me feel algorithms is not hard as I thought. It is worth to learn,5
1025,"I really enjoyed it. Perfect balance of practice and theory together with clear explanations. I also appreciate the mentors efforts that always answer any questions and try to help. Thank you Tim, Vassilis, and Arjit.",5
1026,"This is a great course. The teacher is very clear, and the material is very interesting. The programming assignments are interesting: the problems asked are very simple, but the input is generally too large to use brute force: you really have to implement the algorithms presented in the videos. This makes you realize how much smart algorithms can make a difference.The level of the class is relatively high, compared to other Coursera courses I've taken. If you want some serious training on algorithms, look no further.",5
1027,Good learning,4
1028,"Nice course and exams problems. I recommend this course if you want to understand the basics of graphs, trees and heaps.",5
1029,The material was a little light and far fewer video quiz questions to test our understanding of the material. I also tried to test myself on BFS and DFS by doing online quizzes like geeksforgeeks - bombed really hard.,4
1030,"Excellent mix of math (not too much), programming details (probably needs a little bit more) and practical applications!",5
1031,This is great course and amazing refresher!!!,5
1032,The early part of the course does not make a compelling argument for why we need to analyse complexity. The lectures are interesting but not helpful for use in business.,3
1033,"Super interesting course, I have never seen in my lifetime.Watch me ;))",5
1034,I am really satisfied by the course .....just love the lecture and slides too :) .....,5
1035,"Tim does an excellent job explaining things at depth and at the same time keeping things interesting. The quizes and programming assignments are well thought and carefully balanced vs the material taught. They force you to stretch just a bit beyond the lectures, which is a good thing IMHO.And there is a wealth of advanced/optional material for the curious.",5
1036,I love how clear the videos (and notes) are and re-watching them really helped a lot! I wish there was more discussion on the forms though!,5
1037,It's challenging but interesting.,5
1038,"The best Coursera class I took so far! The instructor has a good pedagogic approach -- for every problem he discusses, he starts with an intuitive explanation illustrated on a simple example, and afterwards provides a rather rigorous justification for the algorithms (omitting only secondary details).I found the problems challenging, and the quizzes required quite some thought, not only repeating/slightly modifying statements made already in the lectures. This made it feel closer to a real class than the other Coursera courses I took so far.",5
1039,"Very much to the point, no nonsense, good course!",5
1040,Many of the weeks' videos were out of order.,4
1041,"Week 4 was significantly more time-consuming than the others, but it is still an excellent course overall. Recommended!",5
1042,Well done!!!! That is the first English course I have finished!!!!,5
1043,"Well done, made a very difficult topic accessible.",5
1044,if u do those math it will definitely help u to be advance,4
1045,It's a very nice course if you're doing some refreshing of college chemistry.,4
1046,"The material was good, but I did notice a couple of lectures and in-course questions presented out of order. What really turned me off, however were quizzes. In weekly quizzes the first answer was always the right answer. In the final quiz most of the questions had the first answer as the right answer. Since randomizing the answers is so obvious and easy, I am really at a loss why the quizzes would be presented in this way.",3
1047,A lot of calculation errors and incorrect answers,2
1048,Great!,4
1049,"Excellent course, very challenging, instructors take the time to explain the work very well.My only suggestion would be that week four be split into two more manageable sections, as it was quite large and there were many different topics covered. As aqueous equilibria are not my strong suit, it was a lot to take in",4
1050,Thank a lot,5
1051,Great Course,5
1052,"The course is well-structured, clear and coherent. The assessments are quite good too. Recommend it!",5
1053,"Excellent course. If you are struggling with high school chem, or need a good foundation for college chem - this course moves you through the concepts and gives you lots of practice problems.",5
1054,"It is a good course for beginners, but it is too slow for advanced learners who want to refresh their knowledge.",4
1055,I did the course before. It was amazing!,5
1056,I am new to teaching AP Chem and this class was a great refresher for me....I suggested that my students enroll.,5
1057,"Although I had taken this course and higher levels in the past, there are still many subjects that I do not feel I have mastered them. This course helps me to achieve that goal. Also, it does not mean that this is not a flawless program, but by far is much much much better than the program I had attended in the past.I like to appreciate both instructors for their time and the effort they have put into making these wonderful videos for many students around the world!",5
1058,This whole program is so knowledge-giving...thanks to Coursera and University of Kentucky.😊,4
1059,"There were some mistakes and weird glitches, but overall solid overview of second-half chem",4
1060,Great.. I'm chemistry.. And this course is very useful to remember all things have you learnt in the university... Thank u,5
1061,This is realy helpfull and interesting.,5
1062,Itt's great! Nicely explained with step by step resolution of problems. I loked it :D,5
1063,Great explanation. I am very satisfied.,5
1064,thank you for the course. great,5
1065,i like it but there is ALOT to do i am 13 taking this for science class and i am starting to get lost in what the are saying,2
1066,"Needs some means of feedback. Several times I felt sure that a question was wrong, but there's nothing to be done about it. Additionally, it would be nice if, after completing (and passing) a test, you could see what you did wrong and how the answer should have been determined.",4
1067,very easy to follow,4
1068,The course is very well organised and presented.,5
1069,Very Good course ! Hope to see Organic Chemistry and some Biology courses by University of Kentucky like this.,5
1070,It's great! Thank you for everything :)),5
1071,"amazing course. all topics about chemistry are here, very good quizes. a good course",4
1072,"I used this course as a significant portion of my preparation for the CLEP Chemistry exam, and passed today with an A! Thank you!",5
1073,"This was a fantastic course! The teachers taught the material well and were entertaining in their teaching methods. I enjoyed that the lectures were easy to watch, and I appreciated all of the practice problems.",5
1074,kind of boring and I am not learning how half this info is obtained or why it is relevant to real world chemistry,3
1075,Thank you for reviving my interest in chemistry!,5
1076,The subjects are very well covered. Great explanation. Very recommendable,5
1077,Excellent lecture videos with practice problems that are very helpful in recalling the chemical concepts. Really wish this course could offer at least an SOA so learners can be more motivated.,5
1078,Thoroughly enjoyed this course! Problems and assignments are quite challenging but doable,5
1079,"Very challenging, well presented.",5
1080,This challenging course improves understanding of algorithms and is intellectually stimulating. I learnt the theory behind algorithms and how they are applied to solve real world problems.,5
1081,"Awesome! The professor is obviously very knowledgeable about the ancient Greece history and it's a pity that I'm done with the course; I wish I could attend the full, comprehensive version of it! On top of the basic history, I appreciated the comments on the research method, the nuances in the interpretation of different events, the presentation of additional elements (e.g., pictures, maps, artifacts) to support the lectures, etc. I was sometimes rushing a bit to go through all the reading assignments but I'm glad to know now what to read and where to search to get more information on the topic. I think it's one of the good side-effect of this course: it motivates you to learn even more about the ancient Greeks. Thanks!",5
1082,"Very good. The readings indicated helped to expand my knowledge of Ancient Greece. Every undergraduate student in History, Philosophy, Archeology etc, must take this course.",5
1083,Great course! Very touching and devoted instructor.,5
1084,"Excellent overview and introduction to Greek history. I am travelling to Greece later this year and wanted to get a better understanding of Greek history to appreciate the art, literature, architecture and sites which I will be visiting. This course was both educational and entertaining. I highly recommend and look forward to building upon the knowledge acquired in the course. Thank you!",5
1085,"The course was fascinating. At first, I must admit Professor Andy seemed quite dry at first, but as I began to understand his wit, I waited continually for him to deliver something extremely hilarious. I still laugh when I think about the reference to ""Bats whispering"". His understanding of the topic was excellent and his ability to communicate such a tremendous span of critical Western history efficiently and in an organized manner made the course valuable to me. I learned enough to of course understand I knew little, though I have written down several areas I want to research on my own to expand my knowledge. Great course, great lectures, thank you for presenting it to us and helping us learn!",5
1086,"Ancient History: it is not boring anymore (for me)! Charming Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak gives materials in a way, that you feel an every character (even mithological) was a real person involved in a real story. I also like nice sence of humor and a voice of lecturer! A lot of reading was easy and interesting to learn during the course.",5
1087,A fantastic course: Very well-presented and hugely informative.,5
1088,Great course !,5
1089,Comprehensive course. I gained a great deal of information that helped to fill gaps in my own knowledge base.,5
1090,Great Job. Andy definitely is the best.,5
1091,Excellent course. Really inspired me to learn more.,5
1092,What a great course! I have enjoyed it a lot!,5
1093,Very Interesting course that covers a huge range of topics over a long period of time. A very well informed lecturer who can speak about the subject matter in a clear and concise manner.,4
1094,"Fantastic Course! Really well structured, lectures are really interesting and I have really enjoyed it!!",5
1095,Well prepared course.,5
1096,Some great material and I learned a lot. I did in fact complete the course but chose not to submit written material. Sometimes the lecturer was perhaps a little dry.,4
1097,Great course! Loved everything I learned.,5
1098,Excellent course. It has a perfect rhythm and the teacher has a good pronunciation which it is a important detail for no native english like me. I recommend strongly.,5
1099,"Fantastic course. Information packed, but not overwhelming. The links to online readings provide nice context for a lot of the lectures, but weren't in any way daunting. Highly recommend!",5
1100,"Even though the professor talks in a monotone voice, I was so fascinated by the course content that I was able to overlook it.",5
1101,"I found this a really interesting course to complete. The lectures are easily digestible and help to provide context for various readings that you complete along the way. I would have liked an introductory lecture that gave an overview of some of the major themes of the course more clearly (I felt a bit at sea throughout the first topic having never studied this before. I didn't know what to pay attention to). But once we were underway, I had no trouble working out the flow of events. I really enjoyed this- thank you!",4
1102,"I love listening to these lectures. The professor is highly informed on the subject matter and his personality brings these myths and historical insights to life through engaging, clear story telling. I honestly did not know what to expect from the course, but I am deeply interested and hope to retain at least the main points of the lectures to take with me in my understanding of the world and the development of our richly influenced society by the Ancient Greeks.",5
1103,"I like this course, it covers a wide range of topics.",5
1104,"A good starting point to learn more about the ""Ancient Greeks""",4
1105,"Great course, but the quizzes are not quite there yet. They focus too much on minor details and the questions are sometimes awkwardly phrased.",4
1106,"I found Wesleyan University's course ""The Ancient Greeks"" rich in varied information. Professor Andrew Szegedy-Maszak's lectures are particularly thoughtful and the quizzes are clear. An altogether enjoyable, well-worth experience.",5
1107,Very informative and filled with interesting tidbits. I loved it.,5
1108,"Totally excellent and enthralling! The subject matter is well treated and easy to follow. The quality of the videos are top as well. I fell the the mix of lecture, reading and quiz at the end of the week was just right.",5
1109,"excellent course, I enjoyed it a lot!It helped me to gain an overview over ancient greek history.Great lecturer!",5
1110,"Fantastic course. Very enjoyable, quite clear and shed light on quite a lot of complex concepts. It's not hard to follow, but certainly arouses your curiosity and makes you explore more. Thank you for all these great lectures.",5
1111,"An excellent course, one of the best I’ve done at Coursera. I hope Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak will give more courses on this subject, starting with the end of this course, the 4th century BCE, progressing to the 3rd, 2nd etcetera BCE!",5
1112,Cool,5
1113,Perfect!,5
1114,The professor was extremely knowledgeable and clear.,5
1115,Wonderful course !,5
1116,I love the way this professor talk about events. I learned so much.,5
1117,"I love this class. So much important history that can be related to current events and people. I highly recommend everyone to take this course and think about it. We still make the mistakes these people did, and the successes are a part of our existence today. Instructor is very pleasant too.",5
1118,Quality Qu,5
1119,Inspiring instructor. A lot of clarity in the lectures and some really interesting facts and stories. This course is almost like watching a great movie.,5
1120,"Thank you so much for conducting such a well paced course to the prelude of Greek's history!The course was simply fascinating! Professor Andrew's teaching style was very detailed, often humorous and also engaging. It felt as if I was really present in one of his lectures in the university classroom!The provided reading assignments also immensely helped in gaining an in-depth understanding of the course content!The active discussion forum gave me the opportunity to fine tune my learning through Q/As and additional articles for further reading, provided by the very generous, friendly and encouraging mentors!Looking forward to such a course in future,With best regards,Saoumitaa G",5
1121,"I have learned many issues and insights, and I am most satisfied.",5
1122,"The professor certainly knows a lot about this subject, but his delivery is stiff and dry. If he shared his passion for the subject with us it would be more enjoyable. On the plus side, I admire how he shares the Greek language with us so capably and combines art with his lectures.",2
1123,Really interesting course,5
1124,I will keep thinking with the Greeks.,5
1125,Best instructor and lectures covering the entire area..But Assignments should include more questions so that to cover entire content of course.,5
1126,"So thanks Prof ,i think that it was a great course and really my hope now is to visit Greece to recall Homer,Socrates,Hesiod,Solon.........................As a course ,Ancient Greeks resource me much and i advice all students to take this wonderful course.",5
1127,"It's really well organized. I like the pace of the course and the voice of ""Professor Andy""!",5
1128,This is my first coursera course and I love it.,5
1129,A global and balance view of the ancient greek history,5
1130,Great! I 'd love to learn about this.,5
1131,"Awesome course, excelent material, great classes.",5
1132,Excellent course!It is a must take course for the lover of Ancient Greece.,5
1133,"The course is very well structured for a diverse range of learners. You could get a very deep knowledge and understanding through the readings (Greek tragedies, Herodotus, Thucydides etc) and the lectures, or a broad survey of the Ancient Greeks by just watching the videos. The professor also combines the narrative, the methods used to study those narratives and the limits to our knowledge in an erudite yet engaging manner.Definitely recommended as a top quality resource for anyone who wants to learn about Ancient Greece.",5
1134,"An excellent course for those interested in an introduction to classical studies. I studied roman history and latin at high school, and I was eager to learn more about the ancient greeks. This course provided me a great introduction. And it raised my interest in reading ancient greek authors. That was the strongest point for me: no need of animation, I liked the invitation to read ancient texts.",5
1135,This is an excellent course and I have enjoyed listening and reading everything it has to offer.,5
1136,Great Course!,5
1137,WWonderful course.great professor,5
1138,Interesting and informative! Professor is the best!,5
1139,This was an excellent course on The Ancient Greeks. I studied Ancient History and Archaeology at University a few years ago and I found this a brilliant refresher to knowledge I had forgotten. It was well structured and interestingly taught.,5
1140,Very interesting! I wish there is some animation film to explain the narative.,3
1141,Wonderful and interesting course. Thanks!,5
1142,"it´s very interesting course ,it gives you all the details you need in the classic studies .",5
1143,An amazing course! I have found many interesting details and also received completely new way of seeing the history of democracy! Special acknowledgment to professor Andrew Szegedy-Maszak for his work and generous way to give knowledge to the students!,5
1144,It's just plain excellent. Great content and professor.,5
1145,A very interesting course and I'm at the beginning of this course and already have learned a lot about,5
1146,"Outstanding course, delivered measuredly, concisely, and clearly. A wonderful panoramic introduction to the Ancient Greeks. Inspires one to dig deeper. Thank you so much for offering this course on Coursera.",5
1147,This course was simply fantastic ! I was captivated. Pr. Szegedy-Maszak is such a great teacher. He makes you really live and love the subject. I'm looking forward for new courses. Thank you very much.,5
1148,the tests are difficult.,1
1149,"An engaging look at Ancient Greece from the Minoan civilisation on Crete through to the death of Socrates (with some bonus material on Alexander the Great by popular demand!). The course is extremely well-designed and presented by first-rate lecturer, Professor Andrew Szegedy-Maszak of Wesleyan University. Totally recommended.",5
1150,Very informative and interesting!,5
1151,Excellent course! I'd like to thank the professor for such good lectures,5
1152,well presented and thought provoking,4
1153,"Fantastic course. Nicely paced with good lectures and background reading. Highly recommended if you want to learn about history of ancient Greece, with a side order of drama, literature, lives of women, slaves and metics (do the course and you will know who they are). Highly recommended.",5
1154,"I enjoyed this course. It was very interesting, the teacher explained each topic well. A very informative journey through the Ancient Greece.",4
1155,Great course that let you have a quick look over the greek rise and fall over 2000 years ago.,5
1156,"Poor visual aids, course content and format.",1
1157,"It is a good course and the instructor is very knowledgeable on the subject. It´s just that, after a while studying about wars it seems that there´s no ending or purpose. It is a very good analisys though.",4
1158,"Loving this course! Very engaging subject matter and instructor has discussed topics in such a way as to make you want to know more and to continue with the lessons even though it's way past bedtime!I have learned quite a bit so far and am developing further interest in that time period, especially how the Ancient Greeks have shaped societal constructs and belief systems and how they have affected us throughout the ages to modern life as we know it.",5
1159,"The professor is very comfortable lecturing in front of a camera, which makes it quite easy to follow the lectures and what he is explaining.",5
1160,Professor is very knowledgable and honest about the topic. As a student of classical civilizations I loved his simple communication style to explain concepts that tend to become overly complicated by bad professors. Definitely enjoyed,5
1161,"The course was very interesting. My recommendation would be to also include videos as resources, where possible. For example, I found videos of 'Medea' and 'Antigone' on Youtube and watched them and loved them! Since it's theater, it's completely different seeing the play than just reading it.",4
1162,It's a nice way to learn how were the greeks! In a fews words: Awseome!,5
1163,I've found this course extremely helpful as I teach Greek history to my high school classes. Professor Andy explains crucial events in enough detail yet the videos are concise enough to watch multiple in one evening with good comprehension. Thank you so much for the lectures and great resources! They are invaluable to my planning my unit on Ancient Greece!,5
1164,This is wonderful swathe through Greek history. I'm glad I was invited along.Thank you.,5
1165,Great course! Excelente professor,5
1166,"This is an absolutely 5-star course. Educational, interesting, right-paced... It is very clear that the professor has a passion for the subject and is deeply knowledgeable. There are two questions after every video lecture, which focus on the most important parts of the lecture and also helps the student see if they understood the content. Reading assignments are relevant and interesting. End-of-the week quizzes are challenging, but can be completed very successfully if the student paid close attention to the subject. I would recommend this course to everyone who likes history or ancient cultures. I hope for a sequel, too!",5
1167,"Excellent survey course. Only wish there was more information given on details of daily life, also wish the course was a bit longer. Had issues with verifying the quizes.",4
1168,"Professor Andy lectures really made me enjoy my time spent learned and studying about the Ancient Greeks, now having skimmed the top of some history of the Ancient Greeks I look to discover more by myself and as suggested in this course. ""Think like the Greeks."" Good day.",5
1169,"I found The Ancient Greeks course to be excellent, highly informative and well presented. I found the lectures, use of maps and pictures of ancient artifacts to be most useful in supporting the topic. Highly recommended.",5
1170,Absolutely superb course by lecturer who knows the material inside out.,5
1171,"The lecturer was quite knowledgeable, but I think he needs to work on his presentation a bit. Particularly at the start of the course he didn't quite know what he was trying to say",4
1172,"I had forgotten how much reading there is! I didn't have a lot of time, but I enjoyed the lectures a lot and it revisited my interest in history and ancient civilizations. I think I learned more from this than the Ancient Civ class I took many years ago in college! Most enjoyable!",4
1173,"Very good course. I'm enjoying this immensely. Maybe a little less recommended reading, some of the readings are repetitions.",5
1174,Informative and enjoyable,5
1175,Well presented and very enjoyable.,5
1176,"Well presented, wonderful insight into the world of the ancient Greeks. I learnt a lot, and it has whetted my appetite for more. I really loved this course, and enjoyed it very much indeed",5
1177,"Elaborate and absorbing lectures, it was a great pleasure to follow. Thank you, PhDAndrew Szegedy-Maszak! All the best, MK",5
1178,Gave me a great overview of the ancient greeks. I now would like to visit these ancient places.,5
1179,A lesson with discussion about the question of quizz.,3
1180,I love history and so this class is perfect for historians alike.,5
1181,An extremely intresting and informative course!,5
1182,It is a great educational experience that opened the door to the ancient Greek history.,4
1183,"I knew nothing about ancient Greece before. Excellent course. Thanks. David Pearsall, Greenville NC",4
1184,"This is exactly the model that other humanities and ""soft science"" courses should follow on Coursera. Your grades and progress are solely based on your own performance and not on the whims of student reviewers. One is also spared the experience of grading the work of others which is often nearly as painful of a punishment as undergoing a root canal sans anesthesia. Other instructors and the leadership of Coursera need to pay attention to how this course is set up in order to make their own future endeavors better for their students.",5
1185,Very interesting and well explained.,5
1186,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The lectures were easy to follow and the additional reading material fit to the lectures. I would subscribe to a follow-up course any time!,5
1187,"wonderful really interesting course, well presented and full of fascinating information; well worth doing",5
1188,Limited in scope but very good for the time/topics it covers.,5
1189,"A Great course. very Informative I recommend it to all who want to learn a lot about the ancient Greeks their culture,history and contributions to today's society.",5
1190,The reading assignments were really good and the pace of the course was very effective.,5
1191,Very very good course!,5
1192,"I loved this course and I was a bit sad when I finished it. I found it very interesting and the teacher was very good explaining and making it simple enough. The material used (presentations, maps, photos) really helped to round up the lessons. Overall, a ver",5
1193,Perfect course,5
1194,A really great course!!,4
1195,"Even though it covers some topics a little ""superficially"", this course is of great value for those who want to get more knowledge about the history and development of ancient Greece. It is really interesting that it does not only cover political and military issues, but also daily life and civic aspects of this civilization.Really recommendable!",5
1196,"Excellent overview of Ancient Greek history. Very much enjoyed the lectures with clear explanations of different aspects of Greek political, military and social structure and the differences between the different polis. Reading material was enjoyable as well -- appreciated the opportunity to read, or reread in many cases, Herodotus, Thucydides and Plutarch. The mixtures of readings also gave the opportunity to view different persons and events from different perspectives which was refreshing. I highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in Ancient Greece or the beginnings of facets of Western culture.",5
1197,Professor Andy can tell a story and is the best damn Professor at wesleyan!,5
1198,"The profesor is excepcional, and have a very good english, Thank you",5
1199,"Very interesting class. The readings were helpful in understanding a deep appreciation for the subjects covered. Still dislike the multiple guess questions at the end of each section, think essays would show mastery of the bigger picture, but understand the constrains of time on the professor. Still, I would recommend this class as a basic introduction to Ancie",5
1200,"What an excellent course! The lecturer sets a good pace and is very engaging. The subject matter is interesting, and the course hours per week are very reasonable. I also really like the MCQs to consolidate your learning at the end of each lecture.",5
1201,A very interesting and useful introduction to the Ancient Greeks era.,5
1202,Good introduction to the period - balances political history with wider social and cultural topics. Well supported by original source material. Maybe the expectations of weekly reading are set a little high for many students. I personally found the sections on early Greece particularly interesting as I was least familiar with that era.,4
1203,"Excellent course! Very knowledgeable professor, yet easy and pleasant to follow. The programme is well structured and the content approached with some depth (considering the introductory nature of the course). I would have loved to see, though, a focus more on philosophy (pre- and post- socratic), visual arts and the Hellenistic period, as it is most of the times neglected, even in today's historical accounts. Hope to see more courses on Classical Studies soon at Coursera.",4
1204,The course is ok. But we need really less lectures and more application based courses.,4
1205,Brilliant course. Superbly assembled and presented material. And I love the prof's wry sense of humour!I've been wanting to learn about this subject for many years. Highly recommended.,5
1206,"Ancient Greeks is brief overview of Greek civilization from about 1800 to 320 BC, starting with the Minoans of Crete and ending with the death of Alexander the Great. Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak demonstrates great knowledge about the subjects, covering literature, government, and philosophy.Yet the course has two setbacks: 1) The professor stutters through the lectures, displaying his obvious discomfort being on camera; and 2) the overview is very expansive, so there isn't great study in any single theater of Greek civilization.There is, however, solid coverage. I also felt the chapter on the 4th cent. BC, done to address complaints about no coverage of Alexander and Macedon, feels tacked on. It's a long, but somehow hurried lecture.That said, I liked this course. I gained greater knowledge of important political and literary figures, such as Solon and Alcibiades, than I did when I studied the subject back in college.",3
1207,"Excellent course. Professor's Andy's calm and careful delivery is precise, scholarly and entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the readings, which I urge other students not to skip.",5
1208,A wonderful guided tour of ancient greece from the bronze age through Alexander. Thank you!,5
1209,"Material is excellent, but new format for coursera pages is horrible. Hard to find anything, taking pdf dumps to create saved artifacts from class is completely broken, quizzes do not allow you to see your answers after you submit them even after you have finished the class so you have to remember to save the quiz answers before submission. Worst part for me is that you can only get a certificate if you agree to verified certificates which means giving coursera access to your webcam and also allowing them to save your typing patterns with to me I don't mind paying something for the courses, but will not use verified certificates as I have no need for their verification, and will only take on demand classes that use this format if they have content i really want.",5
1210,very useful for newcomer,5
1211,"This is such a wonderful class, though it's kind of hard... But I like it very much!",5
1212,"It was a great course, I really enjoyed it.Thank you very much.",5
1213,COMPLETAMENTE RECOMENDADO PARA CONOCER LA INGENIERÍA QUE SE APLICA EN LOS SISTEMAS DE TRANSPORTE,5
1214,very good i leran to much,5
1215,great course in transportion,5
1216,"Great course, loved it! Maybe a bit easier than the previous ones in this specialization, or maybe it's just because I started using python(compared to java and c in previous courses). Anyways the course was fun. :)",5
1217,Far too easy,2
1218,Great content! And explained very well. I was asked a question on graphs in my amazon interview. Wish I had taken the course earlier. Thanks!,5
1219,Nice and clear!,5
1220,It was one of the best course. The problems in the programming weekly assignments were very carefully designed. All the mentors were really amazing and having in-depth knowledge in algorithms. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and I feel I am much more comfortable tacking graph problems and solving them efficiently. Thank you!,5
1221,"Overall good course, programming tasks are fun!However, some of the video lectures are only of average quality. Accent of the TA is sometimes confusing (fyi I'm not a native speaker).",4
1222,Very good course. Learn a lot.,5
1223,"Great course, thank you!",5
1224,Fairly good course. I wish the edge cases for some of the programming assignments had some more discussions. Needed some sifting through the forums while stuck.,4
1225,"This was a really excellent little unit. I really appreciate going over all the algorithms in this course and I have a better understanding of how we explore graphs to find valuable information. I really enjoyed the challenge optional week as well. I felt less stress to complete it since it was optional, but it was still very challenging and I couldn't complete it (even though I really tried). I feel the challenge optional week may need to be made slightly easier though to give people who are normally busy to get a chance to try and solve the problems in it (it did eat up a lot of my spare time). Excellent work, great course (wish I knew contraction hierarchies better, been reading some papers but still unsure of how to best implement it).",5
1226,"Great course, great lectures!",5
1227,"Lectures were very clear and assignments were really helpful for me to understand gist of each algorithms. This course, however, only covers 1. Basic concepts of Graph, 2. Shortest Path, and 3. Minimum Spanning Tree which doesn’t seem to be rich.With more diverse and interesting problems associated with Graph included, I strongly believe that students will get much from this course.Thank you",4
1228,Was very informative course. Learned a lot stuff.,4
1229,Good sessions and assignments.,4
1230,Very interesting and well presented course. I particularly wanted to learn more on graphs and this helped me get not only a basic but a more advanced understanding.,4
1231,Incredible collection of graph algorithms. Thoroughly enjoyed it.,5
1232,very nice course. The content covered is very useful.,5
1233,"I loved it, great work from the instructors!while ( true ){thank you very much ;}",5
1234,"Outstanding. I highly recommend paying for this course instead of auditing it, so you have access to the graded homework assignments. The problems are ingenious, and so much fun I wish I could do them again. Without doing the assignments, I wouldn't have learned as much as I did. It's well worth the money.",5
1235,Amazing content. Loved it!,5
1236,great course,5
1237,Great,4
1238,Another great course. Thanks a lot!!,5
1239,Very good explanations,4
1240,"The course was awesome but the ""Algorithms on Graphs"" course the month after has some ridiculous extras. Since the course hereafter will have additions related to how Graphs are used in the real world today - I have to give this current course 4 stars. I can't comment on the next course but I think talking about how graphs are used in RL is immeasurable. Good Luck. I do hope you give this course a chance if you're interested in Graphs or looking for a refresher like I was.",4
1241,"Good course , nice assignments , a little bit more of explanation might be helpful for beginners",4
1242,"Fantastic course! I am new on graph algorithms and this course totally mesmerized me. The course material is just right for me , neither too difficult nor too easy. And the programming task is challenging and I like the way the test cases not shown to us because it pushed me to think of strange or rare case on which my program may fail. I really learned a lot from this course! Thanks to the instructors!",5
1243,Instructors in Algorithms on Graphs manage to provide a placid -yet complete- course.,4
1244,Great course! it would be better if the course provide more problems that is not directly the implementation of what is taught,5
1245,"Great course, would have been better, if authors added more assignments and material to study as graphs have so many applications. Anyways, I do believe that motivated learners will go ahead and find more challenges for themselves. As always, thanks to all the instructors, keep up the good work!",4
1246,Great Course,5
1247,Interesting course to start learning about graphs,4
1248,"Awesome explanation, very concise.",5
1249,It helped me to understand graphs from a programming point of view. I got fun when solving the problems.,5
1250,I really enjoyed the course.,4
1251,Great Course. Compact and clear. Learnt a great deal from it. Thanks!,5
1252,"Fun course, well done. Overall I felt the class materials were very handled in this course. Further, it was tightly focused on a related set of algorithms where knowledge of each built on preceding knowledge well. Everything I need from a distance/on-line course and presented well.",5
1253,"For me this was a refresher. And it was an excellent way to explain and work on graphing algorithms. The step-by-step explanations of the algorithms here are great for truly understanding what's going on under the hood, so to speak.",5
1254,Very informative and useful content just like the other courses in this series.,5
1255,Good Questions and very good Test Cases.,5
1256,All basic graph algorithms are covered.,5
1257,"This is an interesting course, which is closely related to the graph theory in mathematics. As the previous courses, programming assignments are given every week but it is slightly harder than before. Some pseudo codes are not that easy to convert into the programming language. Yet, it is one of the excellent courses in Coursera.",5
1258,"The course contents and assignments are clear and well-structured. Compared to the algorithms & data structures courses, this one was a lot easier (for me anyway). I would have liked additional content on, for instance, (Markovian) grids/fields, but perhaps this will be covered in the 'advanced algorithms' course.",4
1259,"useful and fundamental, interesting assignment",5
1260,The teaching quality is very average and mediocre at best.The assignments are merely implementation of lectures .The Stanford and Princeton courses on Algorithms are better courses to take for one to pursue a serious study of Algorithms.,2
1261,Excellent! I learn some new algorithms on graphs.,5
1262,worth looking at the course,5
1263,"Another great course! I started this one right after completing data structures and found it particularly interesting as graph problems seem to pop up everywhere in our modern, networked world.Compared to the data structures course this definitely felt easier, however this may be down to me being more comfortable with my chosen language as well as with the overall process and structure of the assignments. Nevertheless there are some fun problems here that have connections to problems in the ""real"" world.As a side note, I recommend doing the data structures course before this one, as some of the algorithms discussed rely on data structures, so understanding them and better yet having them implemented already will help a lot with focusing on the new material and passing the assignments.Thanks again all the teachers for the great course!",5
1264,The way the prof. teaches is really amazing . I got all whatever he said and i really enjoyed the course.Thanks to Coursera team for putting up this course for begginers like me and special thanks to the Professor .,5
1265,very bad course,1
1266,"This course is easier than the previous three, but will help in gaining basic to intermediate knowledge on graphs.",4
1267,"Really Good Course , Problems are of good quality , the content is time saving and easy to understand.",5
1268,This review is based on the last three courses that I have undertaken in the Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization.While running our tests the output does provide the time and memory used for running our algorithms. I think it would also be instructive to see the running time of the best implementation in the particular language and the best time achieved ever by a student in such a course. It would provide us with an additional motivation to think about better and efficient implementations.Note: I do understand that running times might not always be an exact reflection of the actual time the algorithm takes.,5
1269,Very good explanations. The course assignments were well thought-out and were the right difficulty.,5
1270,Great Course to understand the graph algorithms and hone the skills to solve the Graph Problems.,5
1271,"I must say I feel disappointed especially when the whole Data Structures and Algorithms series take this course as the selling point ( ""you'll learn how to compute the fastest route between New York and Mountain View thousands of times faster than classic algorithms and close to those used in Google Maps"", blablabla), but it turns out to be the least challenging course with only elementary introduction to the big topic. Perhaps the preparing time for this course is too short? I still miss the teaching style and assignment design of the first course of the series though. It would seem to be unwise to pay for the following courses if this continues on.(FYI I was the among the first ones who take this series, and I have got 100% grade for each course ever since then.)",3
1272,Why don't you put it in the Data Structures course?,5
1273,"The course is too shallow - amount of topics discusses is quite small. Practice tasks are boring - implement pseudocode given in lectures. No quizzes. In particular you can see that it is a bad course, if you compare it to the previous 2 courses in the specialization. I'm agree with other people posting in forums about that.Wasted time, could spend that month more productively. Not going to continue passing other future courses.",2
1274,Thank you for a great course! But the assignments could have been more challenging.,5
1275,Good course!,5
1276,Good work ! Every concept is well explained !,5
1277,Neat and suitable examples for each topics.,5
1278,"Simply fantastic, to-the-point lectures with great insight to look at problems.",5
1279,"I can only give this two stars at most.The lecturers are just like reading the PPT without any heuristic teaching approaches.The assignments make me desperate, always show very poor feedback message -- ""Wrong answer"", even the cases failed because of performance issue.The starter files given from the assignment are inconsistent with the pdf description. It's so confusing.Couldn't get any help from forums.",2
1280,Excellent inputs on graph theoretic algorithms,5
1281,Good Course material and Assignment.,4
1282,Awesome! One of the rare courses that teach everything about Graphs! From the very basic to the very advanced. Together with programming assignments that accommodate almost all available programming languages!,5
1283,Course was to easy and nothing new in it not as the description that it has algorithms 100000 times faster than google.,2
1284,great course .... everything taught in order ... not so fast and not so slow,5
1285,"Prof. explains every algorithm design method such as D&C, DP, greedy very clear. Very nice class.",5
1286,"Brilliant course, very well taught.",5
1287,"really great,but it's a little bit difficult to me...",5
1288,"Good course, every CS student should take.",5
1289,"Although I have taken algorithm courses before, I still learnt a lot from this course.",5
1290,"This course is awesome, the test bed for code is mind-blowing and engaging. Helped me get a job at Google and Amazon.",5
1291,Excellent introductory course on Algorithms.,5
1292,"As a developer without adequate CS educational background, it's very exciting and of great use to take this course. I've got the ""Algorithm in C (Parts 1-4)"" by Sedgewick and did some learning, but it's necessary for me to follow details and explanations from slides and video talks. Also the testing of coding assignment has covered several aspects which I have not paid attention in my daily work.",5
1293,"Wow, good lecturer, free of charge and great teaching experience!",5
1294,Very useful class and you'd better read the book with this course to get more from it.,5
1295,Awesome course.,5
1296,"I started coding with Javascript and Python...and I struggled with this course, having not mastered Java. But the resources were perfect and now I have a large cache of projects and information to draw upon as I progress with Java and more academic/algorithmic problems in my software engineer career.",5
1297,"Very good. The TFs are nice too. Nevertheless for a non-CS student like me keeping up with the course is really tough, especially provided that I have never learnt java language before, and that I conducted all debugging without any debugger(I don't know how to use DrJava). In all the course is worth taking.",5
1298,"Great Course, great assignments, great teacher!",5
1299,"It's a very good course, especially the design of homework.",5
1300,very Nice course. The best algorithm course in the world,5
1301,Best Course that one can take to sharpen his skills. Very thanks to Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne for coming up with this course. Before taking this course I used to think I have reached an end to my goal of learning Computer Science but now I feel the boat I was sailing was taking me in the wrong direction.,5
1302,"Awesome, Thanks a lot for providing free of cost",5
1303,Best course on algorithm. Robert Sedgewick is awesome teacher.,5
1304,"Exceptionally good Lecturer and the course. Booksite, video materials and assignments are amazing. Would recommend this course to everyone! The only improvement i would suggest is the explanation of nearest neighbor search in KD tree. Critical information when to prune the search is not really explained so additional resources should be consulted.",5
1305,thanks ~,5
1306,The best course I have taken so far for introducing algorithms. I must say the exercises and programming interview questions made the course more interesting and thoroughly tested my understanding. Cheers to the instructors and the team !!!,5
1307,thanks，verygood......,5
1308,"I took this course to refresh my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge in order to prepare for technical interviews, and I'm glad I did. The lectures are great and the programming assignments are very well designed and have sufficient guidance. You really have to work on them. I would have liked more graded MCQs after lectures. This is also the first MOOC I've completed, and it gives me a great sense of accomplishment!",5
1309,"Learn a lot from this course, including algorithm, data structure, Java programming. Get some great ideas. Expect for the Part 2 !",5
1310,"Even though there is a lot of useful information in this course, I personally don’t like it. I wouldn’t take this course again if I had a chance to go back in time.All hometasks are much more about programing in Java than algorithms. Open any week's discussion forum, you will find out that 90% questions and problems are about Java, not algorithms. If you are not a professional programer, you will spend at least 30-40 hours a weak instead of 6-10 hours.5 week’s task is just a pure joke: 30 minutes explanation about most difficult structure in the course and not a single line of code.. After that you must write it by yourself. Just look at week 5 discussion forum. Do you know why there are 42 topics in week 3 and only 7 in week 5? Because people decide not to do it.The goal of a teacher must be to make students love the course\matherial\science, not to hate it. I’m not sure about hating, but it was annoying as hell.",3
1311,Exceptional slides and better teachers!,5
1312,This course is very informative and presents highly useful information in a manner that is easy to learn and remember. Everyone should take this course.,5
1313,great course！,5
1314,Fantastic hands-on course that helps you explore algorithms. You should be pretty comfortable with programming in Java (comfortable with creating linked data structures) to get the most of out of it.Assignments are incredibly well designed and allow you to make progress without much instructor. The discussion board is pretty responsive from other students in the course.A great supplement if you have taken/are taking an algorithm course without any programming assignments (or poorly structured programming assignments),5
1315,Absolutely awesome course on data structure and algorithms. Very easy to understand. Nice figures and demos.,5
1316,very useful,5
1317,"A refreshing course for me, helped me to revise the stuff done long ago",5
1318,"This was a great re-introduction to algorithms for a CS graduate. Great content, fast-paced and the forums were very helpful.",5
1319,"Topics are interesting, explanation is boring",3
1320,a great course of algorithm!,5
1321,it's the best.,5
1322,"This course has an excellent structure. You get a real motivation, why you need algorithm, you understand how it works (with mathematical proof if it's not really complicated), its time/memory efficiency, and finally you practice it. Also, you can learn some Java through this course. I really like how Robert Sedgewick explains course material. Thanks for this experience.",5
1323,An excellent course taught by a living legend.,5
1324,Excellent course. Definitely one of the best out there. Professor Sedgewick does an excellent job getting ideas across.,5
1325,Increadibly good. This is the level that all online courses should strive towards.,5
1326,Very completely!,4
1327,"Really good course, very much helpful.",5
1328,"Great overview course. I have taken algorithms in college, and I am currently a software developer, but I have found this tremendously useful to review the material (especially good for interview prep!). I even gain a better understanding of concepts I thought I knew well already. The professor explains everything in a concise and thorough manner, the homeworks are well thought out, and the hints are helpful. The only improvement I could think of for the course would be to make the lecture sound a bit quieter during the few times the professor would cough -- the mic distortions can be a little annoying. Overall, highly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn basics of algorithms or review the material for interviews or general understanding.",5
1329,Great course and assignments!,5
1330,"The course is very difficult, but the quality is excellent. Due to the stringent grading of the program submissions, I believe more help should offered for each assignment.",4
1331,"it's very nice to explain about what you should learn,and much。。。",5
1332,"As a ten year old Engineer, I recommend every engineer need carefully review at this.",5
1333,Great way of explaining the topics,5
1334,"A superb course, the video and lectures are top class. The exercises are challenging and well set.",5
1335,The auto-graders provide lots of detailed feedback and make working on the assignments a very positive part of the course.,5
1336,Really good course to start learning algorithm at advanced level.,5
1337,"I like this course, the slide and reference book are excellent, and the program exercise let me use the algorithms to solve the interesting problems, let me understand the algorithms more deeply, let me make more efficient code and take care of my code style and the memory usage. Wow, so wonderful, thank you!",5
1338,Excellently clear and thorough introduction to algorithms. Prof. Sedgewick has superb learning skills.,5
1339,really good. I just cannot come up with a course that is better than this. great slides and great project,5
1340,A very good course!,5
1341,What an outstanding treatment of the basic algorithms! 5*.,5
1342,"Excellent course. As an engineering grad who has only done scientific programming in the past, this course really got me thinking about programming in a different way. I had no experience with Java before taking this course, and it was very doable having had mostly only Python and Matlab experience previously. However, if you do not have Java experience, I highly recommend learning basic Java structure and syntax before starting. The course recommends the Duke Object Oriented Programming course, but when I tried it, I found it confusing, slow, and unhelpful from the get go. This web page ended up working great for me because of my background in Python: http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/java4python/index.htm. Also, I highly, highly recommend downloading a Java IDE (I used Netbeans).",5
1343,Great class,5
1344,Awesome course.. focusing mainly on developing algorithmic thinking instead of simply knowing it,5
1345,"excellent course, a must for all CS students or any one else who is interested in programming",5
1346,"Wow, great course, one of the best in Coursera! I enjoyed the lectures a lot, they are engaging and fast paced, the examples of practical applications are interesting; the assignments and interview questions are well thought and challenging.Thanks so much to the Princeton professors who decided to make this amazing material available online. The course is so good I had to buy Sedgewick and Wayne's Algorithms book, not because it was needed for the course (it is not, you have all you need in the lectures), but because they totally rock! Thanks!",5
1347,"Very good course, and tough too, you need good amount of efforts everyday.",5
1348,Awesome course,5
1349,Should be followed by every people who say is a programmer,5
1350,Very amazing course.,5
1351,I really like this course. It is a good recap of algorithms which I learned in my masters. Reasons for going to further approach and examples are given good. I feel if more real time examples are provided it will be good for students to understand where they can apply these algorithms or they can implement their own algorithms.,5
1352,"The course was really good in giving real time examples of the algorithms and its usability in the real world ,the course should also have offered few more assignment covering each topic in the assignments using every component of the course!",4
1353,"Learned a lot from this course, great contents and projects.",5
1354,very interesting course!,5
1355,Enjoyable course and challenging assignments !,5
1356,"Because I don't know Java (yet) and the homework can only be submitted in Java, I audited this course. Time well spent! Even without working the exercises, the lectures were easy to follow and highly interesting. I picked up several things that will likely help me write better code.",5
1357,"One of the best courses I've ever had. Breathtaking, exciting, absorbing!",5
1358,Great course! Very informative!,5
1359,"One of the best courses I've taken so far, related to Computer Science fundamentals. if you need to master data structures and algorithms, this is the course for you.",5

1370,"The contents are extremely useful, and the lecture is clear. The programming assignments are challenging.",5
1371,"The assignments are extremely challenging and enjoyable. The videos can get a bit confusing, but overall a great course.",4
1372,"I used this course for recollection of what I learned at the uni long time ago. It helped me to fill the gaps I'd naturally developed since then, as I don't need that low level understanding algorithms in my everyday work. The course definitely serves these purposes.",5
1373,good course with new things that exite my tech soul,5
1374,This course is amazing! The course lectures are well explained and the assignments pose a good challenge.,5

1380,Excellent course. well rounded.,5
1381,very helpful,5
1382,"Overall, very good course. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star course is the lack of resources around comparing completed programming assignments.",4
1383,"This is a great course and the practical assignments are really cool. But I would like to have more assignments where we have to implement the data structures ourselves, because I thing the best way to learn an algorithms is by going throw the process of implementing and debugging it",5
1384,Great and challenging course to learn data structures and algorithms.,4
1385,This was a fantastic course. I was hoping for a simple review but I learned some new material too. I really excited for part 2.,5
1386,Very helpful! Pretty challenging assignments and well organized lectures. Looking forward to the second part!,5
1387,Pretty good course for the first time java programmer. It covers most of the basic algorithms required to understand by a computer scientist. Really like the idea of place introduction of iterator and comparator within this class. It really boost my understanding of JAVA programming language. Would like to recommend this course to all my classmate. It helps!,5
1388,"Very challenge though, also help me learn a lot through the five projects. High recommend.",5
1389,"while(1==1)S.o.p(""Awesome"");this course is a must do.Thanks Sirs, Thanks Coursera.",5

1392,"My skills in Java were not at the level they needed to be to do the course, but I learned a lot. Thanks!",5
1393,Great course,5
1394,Great course thanks!,5
1395,"An excellent course. I have learnt a huge amount about algorithms. Really, really good!!",5

1397,Very good content,5
1398,Very informative and helpful!!,5
1399,"I have had a great experience during the course. Thank you very much, I have learned a lot of useful things.",5
1400,Very effective,5
1401,Excellent course for beginners and experienced programmers,5
1402,Strongly recommended!This course clearly introduces the basic algorithms and data structures to the students. The professor not only explains the concept of the algorithms but also shows us the applications of them. The homework of this course is substantial and deep. It is really worthwhile to spend time on the homework.,5
1403,Great!,5
1404,"Thanks a lot for this course. Very interesting. Practical tasks very useful, somewhat challenging.",5
1405,Very interesting and clear. Great value.,5

1410,"Great course, assignments and job interview questions are the best part of it",5
1411,"Great course, benefit a lot ! And I will absolutely continue learning algorithms, Part II.",5
1412,Its pretty good!,5
1413,"I really enjoyed this course. The material and videos were carefully made and very informative. The assignments were made that you can properly use the content learned from the lessons. The mentor/instructors are very knowledgeable. It goes without saying the instructors are reference in the Algorithms field.It is worth saying the assignments may require you to research extra resources, e.g. Algorithms 4th book.",5
1414,"I have never studied such a good algorithms class starting from very basics. The best thing which I like most was Java implementations of every piece of algorithms of basic data structures. All videos lectures have detailed explanation of topics. Just a suggestion that - time and space complexity explanations could have been in more detailed so as to understand easily by a novice. Although, the programming quiz questions were difficult, they require every chunk of knowledge you have just studied. Also, adding interview questions related to chapter with hints after your trial and MCQs after every small lectures were charm to the course. I am sincerely looking forward to enroll in other courdses as well. Thank you so much Coursera team, Robert and Kevin.",4
1415,Excellent lectures and hard enough programming assignments. Highly recommended.,5
1416,"Probably one of the best courses on this whole website. The prof and accompanying textbook and website are clear and fairly concise. The assignments are challenging but fair and the autograder works really well so you get instant feedback.Probably the only con is having to setup up Java on your computer which can be a pain,",5
1417,"Typical question of novice of programming: What language should I learn first?Typical answer is incorrect, sadly.Correct answer is: It doesn't matter. Algorithms and patterns matters. I'm not sure about patterns, but Donald Knuth and Robert Sedgewick are best at algorithms. And here you have unique possibility to learn from the best. Rush for it! And be prepared, it won't be easy.And many thanks to Kevin Wayne for his fundamental job. Probably he is the one who we should thank for this great opportunity to learn it here, on coursera.",5
1418,Good start course for digging into cs world,5
1419,Wonderful course !!!! describing efficient basic Algorithms.,5
1420,Great course. Learned a lot.,5
1421,The course is good refresher as well as advanced to meet enterprise needs.,4
1422,"great course, easy to understand!",5
1423,great introduction course in algorithms,5
1424,It is very important course but i hope the videos included Arabic subtitle,5
1425,"Excellent course, concepts are very well explained, with ample amounts of examples. I also really enjoyed how the professor showed real world examples of how the data structures/algorithms are used, so that we aren't learning all this stuff in a vacuum.",5
1426,Changed my way of thinking. Thank you!,5
1427,Great course!Cons: too java oriented.,4
1428,Very Good Content Flow..Thank you.,5
1429,My programming skills reached new heights. Thank you!,5
1430,Great course from great professors. Definitly must-have for any software developer.,5
1431,"Great course. Sedgewick has good educational skills. The course also contains good examples and interesting assignments. I struggled a bit with the first assignments, but then I liked the last 2 better. Looking forward to part 2.",4
1432,Exceptional Course!But a good knowledge and programming experience in Java is highly recommended.,5
1433,The course was very good. The content was explained well. The assignments were the best part. Looking forward to completing the second part of the course.,5
1434,Very good course. Enjoyed it greatly. Wish I had more time to immerse myself in the optional content and practice questions more.,5
1435,complex concepts explained simply !,5
1436,Highly useful course and assignments. Professor teaches great techniques to writing a clean and concise code.,5
1437,This course is incredible.,5
1438,It would be very helpful to let us see the forums of previous sessions.,4
1439,great.hope i will continue to learn untill the end.,5
1440,A gorgeous cource! I've enjoyed while studying.I learned a lot of new.Thanks!,5
1441,Wonderful couse for computer scientists.,5
1442,Absolutely 5 stars!,5
1443,"very good course, and the assignments are very challenge",5
1444,"I had long expected to have some free time to attend this course,and now I finally did it. It's simply great with practical demo and assignments at the end of each week to test the skills acquired.For sure I am going to attend the second part of the course.",5
1445,"This course gives a very good overview of algorithms, justifying each new data structure or technique by examining the performance and technical problems that it is trying to solve, and explaining the meaning of the approach. It is a good idea to do a good bit of coding on your own, however, as the Assignments typically expect you to USE the data structures explained in the lectures from a static library rather than hand-coded.",5
1446,Great course to understand algorithms!,5
1447,"The course gave me excellent insights and it helped me to improve my java skills.The overall presentation (learning material, videos, assignment) is very professionial and good to understand.It would be nice to allow a look at how other students solved the assignments. Maybe with an anonymized grading. Or some kind of a master solution to see, how the best solution to an assignnment would look like.",5
1448,This a very interesting and well-organized course!,5
1449,Very interesting and not so hard. Interview questions are sometimes trickier than practical exercises.,5
1450,Very helpful and detailed,5
1451,Great course. Made me complete many missing points in my programming knowledge. I look forward to see the part 2. Thank you.,5
1452,Amazing experience. Well structured course with a lot of interesting information.,5
1453,Fantastic Free Course. A must seen for programmers.,5
1454,It makes the algorithms more simple and interesting.,5
1455,"This course is very helpful with me. It helps me review a lot of materials about algorithms I've learn from my university. Thanks professors and other members for a great course. If you want to solid your knowledge, don't hesitate to take this course, it's total worth it.",4
1456,Excellent introduction to thinking formally about how to program effectively,5
1457,That is a great course,5
1458,Very interesting course ! It gives a good knowledge about basic data structures and algorithms used in every day programming. Thanks to course authors !,5
1459,Thank you Very helpfull,5
1460,there should be more problem statements for preparation,5
1461,"Amazing course from an inspiring instructor. The course material is excellent. The assignments are demanding, but totally worth the time spent. Thank you for this course!",5
1462,Great course to learn or refresh the algorithmic core!,5
1463,"The best algorithms course. The video lectures are very good. Prof.Sedgewick builds the concepts very well. The code examples/library written by Prof. Wayne and Prof. Sedgewick's code are very compact and the best I have seen. The online website is great supplement to the book. The auto grader is air tight, that forces the student to think and write their code to the specs. My greatest appreciations for Prof. Wayne and Prof. Sedgewick. I wish students have the option to submit their solutions in C++ because in most of the languages the core algorithms/data structures are often written in c/c++ , I understand it is not easy because the course libraries and grader has to written for c++.",5
1464,I think it is a good course. I have known more about time complexity of algorithms and some applications of different kinds of the algorithms. I have spent more time then I though for this course.,4
1465,"Brilliant! I started the Algorithms course with not insubstantial software experience. However, I last took data structures over 10 years ago and decided to give myself a 'refresher' since my area of specialization rarely utilizes structures such as BST's or hash tables.The assignments are 'just right' in applying algorithmic concepts and real-world technical rigor. The problems are focused and contained to fit busy schedules, but, at the same time, challenging enough to provide a sense of accomplishment and to see practical applicability.",5
1466,What a great opportunity to take a course from one of the pioneers of computer science. The lectures are perfectly paced and inspiring.,5
1467,I really enjoyed this course. It was not easy. But it was fun. Now moving on to Part II. :),5
1468,Great course! You really learn to program efficiently. Material very well presented to understand the stuff.,5
1469,"Very solid course. Well explained and informative content and straightforward algorithm illustrations. It not only explains and analyzes mechanism of algorithms, but also offers a set of very practical Java implementations. The weekly programming assignment is awesome. They are well-designed and closely related to real-world application. This is a extraordinary course and I enthusiastically recommend it.",5
1470,"Fantastic course, very appreciate for the Professor and all the contributors of this course. I have learnt so much!",5
1471,As for non-native English speaker and programmer amateur this course is literally a godsend! Thank you!,5
1472,"Fun, engaging, and clearly explained",5
1473,"I learned a lot about algorithms, the best approaches to solving them, and coding them to use the Big-O notation.",5
1474,"This course is an excellent introduction to thinking about algorithms and data structures.It is challenging, in that the assignments can feel overwhelming, but the discussion forums are an excellent place to ask for any clarification.The videos are very helpful, consistent, and well-paced, and the instructor is incredibly knowledgeable and articulate.",5
1475,Excellent course. I would like a similar one but using C++ to learn even more. Congratulations on this great effort you make.,5
1476,"Great open course. Easy to understand, and I really learned a lot from this course.",5
1477,"A great introduction to fundamental algorithms. This course is very well thought-out, the instructor always makes his points very clearly an convincingly: more than just algorithms, this course transmits a way of thinking about them. The material is very well polished, you can feel the instructor has been teaching this topic for so many years. In addition to all of this, the programming assignments' topic are generally quite exciting.",5
1478,This course is pretty good.Algorithms' processing is clear in slide and teacher also explain well.I learned how to design API for data structure.I think it is important.,5
1479,Very interesting course. The basic algorithms learned here are very useful. For game development and big data analysis.,5
1480,Excellent Course. Very interesting.,5
1481,awesome introductory course on algorithm!,5
1482,"Brilliant course, hope that some materials such as some smart design (back flush in lesson 1,etc.) could be documented. Thank you dear professor",5
1483,Very good course. It really helped me to understand what is the algorithm complexity and how to estimate it.,5
1484,"It was a terrific course, and I learnt a lot. The lectures were very interesting, and the assignments were engrossing.",5
1485,Challenging and interesting assignments. Recommend for those with basic programming background.,5
1486,Great instructor. Amazing auto-grader. Interesting content. I want to take more courses like this.,5
1487,Very good Course.,5
1488,Extremely well designed course. The assignments touch all the concepts taught in the class. Lot of concepts get clarified when you try to reach 100% on each assignment. Highly recommend this course.,5
1489,I learned so much from this course. Thank you. I will recommend it to all my friends.,5
1490,it's really a fantastic course!,5
1491,This is a great course of algorithms I have ever seen . great!,5
1492,The course lost a lot without tests. Theory is great. Assignments are pain in the azz - too much is assumed here and there. You must resubmit like a dozen of times to figure out what is wrong.,4
1493,"Super course! I love all the assignments. and the upload-and-feedback system. The lectures are also very good. I did not use the interview questions.Getting the course done in time and working full time simultaneously is very hard, though, but I don't really have any programming experience with me, so that might make it harder.",5
1494,The best.,5
1495,"I really like this course. I think the pace of video is appropriate, clearly explaining the main knowledge of each part but not digging into details too much. for me,I never learned algorithm or java before, but I can mostly grab the lecture content. Another reason I like about the course is the amazing programming assignment part. Each assignment is a little bit challenging but not overwhelming and you can exactly know how well you did through the precisely computing grader system. Thanks for such a wonderful CS course!",5
1496,"This is an exceptional course - best I have seen, in fact. I'm excited to take Part 2 (and buy the book). Thanks very much to Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne for putting together such an amazing learning resource and making it freely available.",5
1497,Good course and assignements(make you think). I liked it.,5
1498,Awesome course! The best I ever seen.,5
1499,very useful,5
1500,The best course on real life algorithms and theirs application.,5
1501,Great for course.,5
1502,"Excellent course, clearly explained lectures and interesting programming assignments.",5
1503,Great course. I'm really glad I took it.,5
1504,"This course is pretty good, for part 1, the lecturer covered some basic and essential things in algorithms and data structure. Everything is presented in a clear order.",5
1505,"Great lectures, great programming assignments and grading, overall I really enjoyed this course. I tried to get through it 2 other times and finally had the time & patience to do it and I'm so glad I did. Thank you!",5
1506,"The grading system is very helpful for debuggingA little suggestion, personally i would not go to the forum unless i meet problems, but actually i find i may missed some great thinking for ignoring it. It would be better if there is a subscription feature like what's trending on the Forum to reminder learners to participate in the discussion.And i like the every week's interview question, thank you for all your effort!",5
1507,"Great course, really enjoyed it - opened my eyes to the performance implications of the code I write!",5
1508,Excellent lectures with very structured yet interesting contents. The homeworks are very useful!,4
1509,"Great, Thanks all",5
1510,Great explanations and very good assignments.,5
1511,Great course!,5
1512,"Good course for a free one. Thank you for all of your great work. Somehow, the pace is too fast. Covering about 2 sections per week is by far too hard to read the book along with the class. There's no practice exercise to strengthen what you learn. The assignment is very hard and sometime don't directly implement the knowledge you learn in that week. Sometime the video sound is too quiet (but you can read the transcript when it happened.) The book is better in my opinion.",3
1513,Would be great to have a certificate,5
1514,There is very informative course. It has understandable explanation of algorithms and data structures.,5
1515,Great lectures!,5
1516,This is the best course for learning Algorithms,5
1517,It is the best algorithms course I have ever taken.,5
1518,Did this course second time but still felt i learned a lot new. Amazing work in creating the course so educative and structured.,5
1519,"very nice!It will be better if we can be offered some quiz and feedback,not only coding assignment.",5
1520,Very useful. This is the best course I've had done in my school,5
1521,Great course!,5
1522,Exceptionally good. I am a working professional with 13+ years of development experience and still found this course to be full of high value and knowledge. I really never looked at these algorithms the way it is represented in this course. I am very thankful to Coursera and Princeton University for making this course available to everyone.,5
1523,"I really liked the videos and the lecture slides. I think the assignments were really good as well, but had the feeling sometimes small but important informations were missing or not placed well enough. I read the description for the 8puzzle half a dozen times, but that this is not actually solving the task in the optimal amount of moves but rather in some arbitrary amount of moves (we just output the optimal moves) somehow escaped my attention.",4
1524,This course is very systematic about basic algorithms and theoretical knowledge about analysis.,5
1525,This course is helpful,4
1526,Outstanding! Would recommend this class to anyone interested in software construction.,5
1527,This course is simply fantastic. The instructor's code is most elegant code I have ever seen and it was very illuminating to see how these fundamental algorithms are being implemented in such an elegant and efficient way.,5
1528,"Excellent course. One of the best courses I have taken from coursera. Very well explained, with a lot of implementations in Java.",5
1529,"I enrolled this course last year and quit at week 3. But I finished it this time and it's the first CS MOOC I finished. It's a really hard but really worthful six-week. It led me into the world of algorithm and helped me improved my English a lot.Thanks to Sedgewick's gorgeous lectures, Wayne's patient answers at Discuss forum and every fellows participate this course.",5
1530,The best fundamental data structure and algorithms course I have ever experienced.,5
1531,"Loved it, basic knowledge for any serious programmer",5
1532,It was an amazing experience. Many thanks for such a good theoretical information and challenging practice. Every single time I had one question - can I do better. Knowledge obtained from this course is outstanding. Thank you again,5
1533,amazing class! the best class that I have ever seen!,5
1534,"I find Prof. Sedgewicks' moderately paced lectures very concise and easy to follow. His animated demo of each algorithm clearly demonstrates how the algorithm works. I find the problem sets challenging and fun, and finally finding an optimized solution as very rewarding, especially when I get the bonus scores. While this course uses Java as the programming language, I find the concepts quite easy to apply in other programming languages such as C. Thank you very much course staff for offering this excellent course for free here at Coursera!",5
1535,the professor is very kind. strongly recommend this course.,5
1536,Good course!,5
1537,"Challenging, but a greater refresher on some core Computer Science topics.",5
1538,"It makes me learn so much,thank you so much.",5
1539,"Great course. As for me it is ideal. I dont have a CS degree, but works as java developer. The course shows me the beauty of algorithms!",5
1540,"I've been through several courses over the past year, some really good, some pretty poor, both here and on Edx, but this one has really no match to find. I would recommend this to anyone, and especially to those planning on creating a MOOC, as this one is really a state of the art :)",5
1541,Strongly Recommend For Algorithm Study！,5
1542,Great!,5
1543,Homeworks are super fun and challenging!The lectures are super clear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
1544,Simply Awesome.,5
1545,"The material and the teaching method are absolutely amazing. Not just a course for algorithms, but a course on ""how to teach a course right"" .. very thankful to the instructors and facilitators.",5
1546,Great course from Professor Robert Sedgewick. Strongly recommend.,5
1547,"One of the best courses I have taken Coursera, edX or any MOOC provider. I will definately follow the algorithm path (Alg I, Alg II, Analysis of Algorithms)",5
1548,The course is a quality course for anyone wanting to learn algorithms(especially in Java).,5
1549,very useful course,5
1550,Great.,5
1551,I'm taking this for the second time to strengthen my knowledge. The course is one of the best I've taking online in the past few years. This is one of the courses I would pay money for because it is very valuable to me.,5
1552,Good course course with good instruction from professors,5
1553,it‘s a nice course,5
1554,"In one word, It's awesome course",5
1555,Excellent beginning for some one who wants to understands algorithms.,5
1556,"Thank you for creating this course. It simply, step by step explains concepts in algorithms.",5
1557,"Interesting material, but its presentation is haphazard and incomprehensible. In typical Latin American style, the presenter wanders erratically through the material in the videos in a confusing and non-linear way, so that making coherent notes is impossible. The relationship between the video, quiz and supplemental reading is sometimes hard to determine. The workload is also vastly different from week to week, including one reading of over 200 pages, indeed a whole book - whilst other lectures demanded only a few pages' worth. Sadly this course was one I abandoned - I lost patience with its random and frustrating structure and the limiting and perplexing nature of the quizzes. I should point out I am bilingual so this was by no means a language issue. If you have the patience for this, or are used to this style of learning, go ahead. I've had to stop, sadly.",2
1558,Ha sido un curso muy interesante y útil. Lo recomiendo para saber como América Larina funciona en estos momentos. Los documentos adjuntos son extremadamente necesarios para disfrutar del curso!It was so interesting and useful. I recomend it to know about how Latin America is working at this moment. The attached files are extremly needed to enjoy the course!,3
1559,This course should retrieved from Coursera. It is plenty of mistakes. One of the quiz is repeated. Questions do not have relation with lectures.,1

1687,Course is useful for analysts.,5
1688,I learned relevant business metrics and its classification.,5
1689,Was great! I learn a lot of valuable topics that I am using on a daily basis!,5

The topic itself is a little limited, mostly to finance, whereas there would be so much more equally interesting diversity in data to analyse. I just don't dream of money all the time.The course limitations for free attendance get in the way of efficient learning though, using cheap tricks to manipulate you into buying, though I haven't seen these features used this way in other curses, I bet they're using what they teach to increase conversion using any way available.",3
1758,Maybe a little more of application activities but overall very well!,4
1759,"Loved the content and delivery! Just wish the Quiz and Peer Assignment (I have completed both) were allowed to be submitted without purchasing course. As it will involve no additional effort to faculty. Answers are in the MCQ format so there is only one right answer and peer-grading by its nature ensures that little or no faculty time and effort is used.Like in other Coursera courses, Official Duke University certificate could be paid.Thanks you again!",5

1808,Eggar was brilliant.but week 4 i could not understand,4
1809,A very and impressive good insight has been provided.,5
1810,I highly recommend this course as an example of excellence in teaching. EVERYONE should take this class. It's just that good.,5
1811,Great course! Clarifies a lot of concepts.,5
1812,"One of the best courses I've taken through Coursera, but also one of the most enjoyed courses. I'd recommend this course for those interested in learning business metrics and business analysis.",5
1813,"I am confused with the job titles before. But, now with this course I understood the skills required to get into the job market.Thanks for your efforts.",5
1814,"Lots of information, and it helps you start doing something in this field right away.",5
1815,Looking very useful.,5
1816,The course conveys clear guidance on the fundamentals of business metrics to allow for a strong foundation to hear and process facts into business metric questions.,5
1817,"If you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series I suggest you look elsewhere. I was able to complete the first course with ease, but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and does not tie in very well with the how excel is used. Don't be fooled by how easy the first weeks assignment is for the second course of this specialization.**My initial rating for this course alone was 4 stars, but due to the lack of effort and information in the 2nd course of this specialization I have to give this 1 star as these courses are all tied together.",1
1818,"I found this course interesting, but a bit too simple.From the answers of other students that I marked many are non-native speakers of English who hadn't really understood the questions.",3
1819,"I would have liked the course to have been more hands on. I would have also liked to have seen other platforms utilized.Ex:Hypothetical situations to apply course content to.Group assignments with real time chat.Better formatted supplemental readings to compliment the lecture videos.Also, I feel like the instructors failed to explain some of the business jargon used, which wasn't remedied by referencing the dictionary.",3
1820,Good course. Clarity in the tutorials and provides a good foundation for understanding essential business metrics for companies.,5
1821,very informative and great lecture :),5
1822,"Wonderful course for a starter. However, there were (although very few) points where a more structured approach could have helped making things easier to understand.But a very helpful course to understand the landscape of the Business Metrics and their application to real-life business problems.",4
1823,"As a recent college graduate in management information systems, I wasn't taught most of these important business metrics in the context of business, and even then, I was only taught traditional metrics, not the dynamic metrics this course covers. I would highly recommend this course to those who are looking to understand the different measures to check the ""pulse"" of a business.",5
1824,Great introduction to the Subject,3
1825,The coursework was very straightforward and prof. Egger made it easy to understand using applicable real-world scenarios.,5
1826,Awesome tool to understand the basics of why we're doing this specialization. This is the cornerstone of the right usage of the tools we can see in the upcoming courses. Highly recommended.,5
1827,Clear to have basic knowledge to know more about data analyst.,4
1828,"Good introduction to business metrics. I was less enthusiastic about all the investment metrics and formulas, but that might just be me.",3
1829,Great introduction!,5
1830,Quality course to learn the base of business metrics. The key terms are explained in a very interesting way. The quizzes are clever and challenging.,5
1831,"This was a basic, yet interesting introduction into the field of business intelligence.",4
1832,"Everything was either super basic or else more advanced but so niche that it doesn't really apply to everyone and we don't need to learn it in that depth. Would have liked to learn a lot more about how to determine what KPIs you should be measuring in different businesses, what kinds of metrics are important, etc. The very large majority of this course will never be applicable to me.",2
1833,Great class and great intro to get excited about data analysis! Very good class for people with any background.,4
1834,Very Useful and in touch with real life uncertanities,5
1835,A practical course to learn about business metrics for any company,5
1836,"good, but no material and lack of structure",3
1837,This was a great course! The content was relevant and was delivered in a clear and concise manner. I will recommend this course to friends.,5
1838,"I an very disappointed that DUKE hits your up for $79 just to grade the fist quiz (which should cost them $0). This is the fist time I have seen an Institution do this. I can understand charging for a certificate, or for a Final project, but not right out of the gate. I hope that the spirit of Coursera is not changing to a ""pay to play"" site. There are other higher rated Universities that take a more noble approach. I wonder if all the reviewers paid $79 day 1 for this class, or did DUKE recently changed their pricing policy after the reviews...",1
1839,I think the pace is a little,4
1840,Great insights on business metrics with practical approach!,5
1841,Very interesting course,4
1842,Very very entry level information.,2
1843,"Basic, Simplified and great",5
1844,"Well done and useful, Thank you.",5
1845,"Amazing introduction to the specialization, very apt!",5
1846,This Course opened up a new mind for me and just from an intelligence perspective i see the world in a different way. I hope to build upon this. Thank You Coursera.,5
1847,Solid introduction - slightly disjointed and fairly boring presentation.,3
1848,Very good insights provided from a fresher's point of perspective !,5
1849,"Thank you Mr Egger, thank you for the engaging first course which introduced me to the world of business data analyst and data scientist.",5
1850,Loved the overview of the profession and hearing from real data scientists (among others),5
1851,good explanation from sound instructors.,5
1852,"Really useful introduction, helps to orientate oneself on the path to data analysis work",4
1853,I really enjoy this course. It has a lot of information!,4
1854,This course gave us more basic concept of business metrics and many of them are brand new for me. Professor introduce this course very clearly.,4
1855,"Well designed, well taught.",5
1856,This course has been an awesome revision for me about my Management Information Systems concepts.,4
1857,Contributions of the professor in the discussions is wonderful,5
1858,I learnt a lot of new things..thank you!!,5
1859,"It is a great introductory course to business metrics and data analysis, very clear and relevant explanations, in a series of attractive and not too long videos.",5
1860,"For me who thought I knew something about business analysis, this course proved me wrong, and I am very glad I took it. I'm looking forward to complete the specialization.",5
1861,I have enjoyed the course,5
1862,Enjoyed this course and the presenter was lively making for good participation.,5
1863,This course has given me a very good perspective on metrics used by various organizations to help sustain revenue and grow sales.,5
1864,love the concepts and the possible impact to business analysis to overall business success,5
1865,Great course!,4
1866,I thought the course was good - but I think the final case study could have been more specific. I reviewed a lot of colleagues and the quality greatly varied though most got the answers correct since it was a quite general question.,5
1867,Very Useful,5
1868,"Good introductory material. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because most of the material was not directly relevant to my business world (pharmaceutical development).Anyone working in a financial environment or in web-based marketing will learn from the business metric examples given.The investment portfolio metrics are useful for anyone who has personal investments, even if you are not involved in finance professionally.",4
1869,"Excelent!!!, the best course on coursera....!!!!, congratulations.",5
1870,"Very difficult to apply the knowledge without some support material with the content, e.g. PPT slides.",1
1871,Very nice lecture videos and explanations! Totally worth it,5
1872,One of the best courses on coursera.,5
1873,"I would not recommend this course for a few reasons:1. There are no course notes accompanying the video lectures. Transcripts of the lectures in unformatted text files and a glossary are available for download. I really can’t figure why the instructor doesn’t provide an outline of what key concepts he wants us to learn from each lecture. Also, I’m surprised that Coursera doesn't require a basic set of learning tools for a paid class, such as lecture notes or an outline. This might be a good class for you if learn well from videos.2. The quizzes contain ambiguously written questions for no good reason.3. Two weeks in and there is little substance. For example, week 2 includes a few Skype videos of the professor interviewing former students from a Duke Master’s program. They seemed like very intelligent and nice people but the content of the videos offered little value (i.e., nothing new) to someone already working in corporate IT.",1
1874,"Good introductory course, but some kinks need to be worked out particularly in regards to the lectures and assignments.",4
1875,"This is a great course, and a wonderful introduction to the world of Business Metrics. I did wish it was more data driven (in that I really thought there would be more Excel work), but I'm glad that I took this course because despite the lack of data in numbers it has set me up to do well in the rest of this specialization.",4
1876,Great class,5
1877,The idea is whole new to me. Appreciate. Thanks!,5
1878,This was a good course - I have a finance background but it presented some new perspectives,5
1879,Great class.,5
1880,"for a successfull career, turn to this course.",5
1881,A good intro course for those who are starting out.,4
1882,"Good introduction to business metrics, but not enough practical stuff.",4
1883,Very good teachers/instructors.,5
1884,"Concise and interesting course that will help one to understand the basics about business metrics. It is meant for beginners and it is time-saving or better, it's largely up to you, if you want to spend here 1 or 5 hours per week.",5
1885,This course is awesome. It is a must attend course specially for the people who wants to understand business in better ways.,5
1886,Good. Looking forward to next.,4
1887,Great course,5
1888,Overall good introduction to business concepts.,4
1889,"Easy to follow, yet comprehensive introduction to the field.",5
1890,"Good course for those with limited exposure to business metrics. Would be more valuable to include 5 or 6 standard Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) by function (marketing, sales, operations, finance), etc. that will be typically encountered in an advanced undergraduate or MBA program.",3
1891,Short but an excellent review on typical metrics used to analyse business performance.the sort of introductory course any adult should do at least once and ideally review every few years.,5
1892,"This is a very quick and effective class to teach you the language and concepts within business metrics. You will also hear descriptions of data-related jobs - what are the roles and differences in skills applied - and these jobs are fairly universal across all industries. The portion of this course that could be better is when the professor throws a bunch of math into the content. It is basically irrelevant to this course, and in and of itself it is so rushed and introduced so out of context that it is very confusing.",4
1893,A great primer for further data analysis courses.,5
1894,Great course !,5
1895,I enjoyed the content and applications. Can't wait to continue on.,5
1896,Very clear explanations and concise examples. Thanks Prof.,5
1897,Totally loved it. Thank you guys.,5
1898,Coursera does not want to give me a Certificate. I've got 95% for this course,1
1899,Great course!,4
1900,The course title is a bit misleading. There were too much math in the course.,3
1901,It's great to have the chance to learn this course.,5
1902,"This course being an introductory to Specialization, doesn't stand so good alone. What I really liked were the real-world examples of companies. As introductory course it was fine, but id didn't contain practical assignments (as following in Specialization courses do). The structure of the course was ok.",4
1903,"Straight to the point. Technical. Applicable knowledge usable Right Now, current information and illustrations. Understandable and comprehensible definitions, theories and case studies. Personable instructor, down to earth and practical teaching style. Hands-on teaching style with a sense of discourse. These two make a great team! I must travel to Duke to sit in on a class or two live.*My Stamp of Approval.*",5
1904,"Thanks to Professor Egger, it is an excellent course with a lot of information about business, clearly expressed.",5
1905,Very useful knowledge and relevant examples are provided.,4
1906,The course for me was very simple and basic. I recommend it to students who makes their firs steps in this area.,3
1907,Excellent coverage of relevant metrics. Learned a lot!,5
1908,Absolutely phenomenal course - a must for anyone interested in the core functioning of a bus,5
1909,Meh. It was just okay.,3
1910,Great and elaborate explication of data analysis concepts. Thanks!,5
1911,Good overview into Business Metrics. Had some focus on stock/financial terms which weren't applicable to what I was interested in. Overall a valuable course however.,4
1912,"It looks nice this training, but there are plenty of questions on every quiz. I think 15 is too much. I've taken other courses and there are no more than 10 questions on each one.I enjoy the last assignment.",4
1913,It's very helpful for people who wish to understand the basic ideas of the data analysis.,5
1914,I loved the files and links that you guys provided along with the flow of the course. It made a big difference! Thanks!,5
1915,Great course,5
1916,Very Clear and helpful,5
1917,Great course to understand the basic metrics used in business. Content is clear and assignments are representative of the material learned.,5
1918,It is too easy,4
1919,Great course providing insight of business metric and application of data analytics in various business processes.,5
1920,This course taught me some important metrics in business and provided me a base for solving any kind of business problem as a data analyst.,5
1921,Very useful and helpful course provided with fine designed structure and clear illustration.,5
1922,"This course does an excellent job of setting the tone for the rest of the courses through breaking down real-life applications of business metrics and explaining their mechanics. In doing so, it's shed a lot of light into metrics/KPI design for my own work.",5
1923,"The course has all the components that I look for in an online / classroom class:-Instructors that know and understand the topic being discussed.-Instructors are very clear, easy to follow, and well prepared on the material-Clear goals and expectations on what you will be able to do by completing the course-Class material extremely well prepared and easy to follow-Plenty of references and uses of real life scenarios that I can see myself applying in my work (vs. hypothetical a+b basic scenarios)-Classwork and examples are easy to follow making it straight forward to complete homework / labs",5
1924,If you are in data analysis this is a must take!!,5
1925,"Great to learn about cash flow, both positive and negative. Makes sense, a course for the real world.",4
1926,"Good course that introduces the idea of metrics. If you already work with metrics, you will not learn much new.",4
1927,It was great,5
1928,I really did not like the portion that went into detail about business analytics and related career paths. Not a technical skill or ne,2
1929,Great,5
1930,A good introduction course on business metrics. Especially great for those without business background.,4
1931,"Great class. I'm very happy with my choice for a Specialization to take at Coursera. The instructor is not only very knowledgeable, but also explain some very complicated processes in a way that helps in the understanding of the topic.",5
1932,Awesome course,4
1933,The course covers the basics with an in depth analysis to introduce you to the world of business metrics. Learned a lot.,4
1934,Good course to build an overall understanding of metrics used by businesses but could have been better if assignments were more case-based but then again thats just my opinion and if the slides were provided at the end of each lecture--just saves time.,4
1935,"I loved how the instructor not only taught the content of the course, but also took time to articulate the specific career application of the material being learned, giving an overview of the various positions within the field. It gave me motivation and a target at which I can aim.",5
1936,A very good introductory course taught by a master in the field.,5
1937,This course starts off slow and gradually goes very deep into business metrics which provides a valuable view-point on the topic.,4
1938,Very easy-to-study course about actual Business Metrics,5
1939,"This course was fairly basic, but still quite useful.",5
1940,"Generally, a very great introduction for business analytic. However, for non-business major or new to business world, this course can be overwhelming because of its frequent usage of business terms. I will recommend you to take basic accounting and basic operation class before taking this one.",4
1941,Good course for beginners. the final assignment should have been with a detailed data set.,4
1942,Realistic view to resolve business problems. Great learning.,5
1943,"Great Course, highly informative and excellently put-together.",5
1944,A great introductory course to gain insights into what actually happens in different job roles.,5
1945,Very good introductory class on business metrics.,5
1946,This is no real need for this course. Everything sounds like bits and pieces from magazine articles.... I suspect the sole purpose of its inclusion in the specialization is to fund Coursera. $79 at a time....,1
1947,very useful course for me as a data analyst in a website company,4
1948,Very good course,4
1949,I enjoyed this course because it opened up a nice array of new concepts in a clear and understandable way. It's always refreshing to find a well-planned course on Coursera.This is not to say that the course couldn't use a little bit of tweaking though. There are still a few areas where things could be made clearer.,4
1950,Surprising Course! Very good business view.,5
1951,It is a great course for introductory level. It doesn't get too deep into some topics but helps to get a good understanding of metrics in companies.,5
1952,Awesome course,5
1953,"Very good, thanks :-)",5
1954,"Excelent!Very interesting... I could learn a lot with this Course.Thanks for the opportunity!Brgds,Caio",5
1955,It's a fine course that doesn't go into too much depth. A goof overview of business metrics.,4
1956,"This is the most informative class I have taken. Even in financial and accounting field for so long, I would say I have learned more from this one class than a whole semester of course work in school. Here, it really shows you the business application of the skills and that is truly powerful. I love it. Thank you.",5
1957,Very good information. The course had a very effective way of taking some pretty complex concepts of business metrics and explain them in a way that a non business minded person could understand....... That is the epitome of a good course!!,5
1958,"It's a great course that gives a brief business perspective to the metrics involved in companies. However, content in this module can be heavier to give it a more in depth view by the introduction of more terminologies and examples.",4
1959,Helpful course with strong instruction but limited practical application versus other similar courses focused on more topical application of specific tools and functions.,4
1960,"Professor Daniel Egger's lectures are entertaining, informative and relevant. This course has definitely been one of the better courses I have taken on Coursera.Would recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction to the field of analytics.",5
1961,"Great presentation, interesting material. Both fun and enlightening, but there were a few rough edges that could be polished up. Strongly recommend!",4
1962,Excellent course.You can learn about different metrics that the companies use to improve its performance.,4
1963,very useful,5
1964,"The class is a pretty nice overview of metrics in general. it is more broad than it is deep, and sometimes the videos and explanations were not the most easily digested. While the content was helpful, this class could have been greatly improved if slides were provided instead of just a transcript. Finally, some of the explanations and definitions, though interesting, weren't often well tied together. The final assignment case study was definitely useful in thinking about several of the metrics covered over the four weeks.",3
1965,not much is taught here but I guess should be a good beginning for the specialization.,3
1966,Great course for getting an introduction into how businesses work!,5
1967,Interesting course to get to know different business metrics and real life applications!,5
1968,Essential in knowing how your company makes decisions based on numerical data.,5
1969,"Excellent! I'm learning a lot from this course. What I like most about it is that this course is newly open so it contains a lot of information about the current economy, especially the examples. I will definitely spend time to finish all the way to the Specialization.",5
1970,Good class.,5
1971,This is a basic course to learn in Excel to MySQL specialization. Lectures by Daniel Egger are easy to comprehend. Especially it is useful to understand skills required for different job roles in a field of data analysis.,5
1972,I learned a bunch and was regularly challenged to do better. I enjoyed it and would recommend the course.,5
1973,"Great course with lots of practical information regarding finding work actually using the material.More actual case studies and less portfolio theory would have made the course a 5/5. Too much portfolio theory for a class on business analytics: Most people taking this class will never desire to work or have the opportunity to work for an investment bank, so I found it a bit irrelevant.",4
1974,Very good instructor,4
1975,Excelente! All of it!,5
1976,Excellent content and the presenter's enthusiasm is contagious.,5
1977,"Very nice course, even if i'm sometimes overdue with the quizes, i try to make my best to get them in time. Reccomend this course.",5
1978,Good introduction to a data science driven approach and understanding a data science driven career.,4
1979,Great course.,5
1980,Good course!!,5
1981,I love it! Professor threads all the beads together for the aspiring data analysts!,5
1982,Good coverage of basics needed for other courses of this specialization.,5
1983,"It's OK, I think there's a few areas that could use some more depth of explanation. As with a few coursera courses there seems to be an assumption that students know the material being discussed and so it isn't explained. Most of the time in this unit that isn't the case but it does occur a bit.",3
1984,It's fairly dense with sensible things to know and do.,4
1985,"Not so technical in these business metrics, a bit unclear in defining all of these metrics. However, give me a very good mindset about how data analyst looks like and what skills do the position require. I am really looking forward to the rest of courses from this combo.",4
1986,"Lots of great technical information that was accessible for me, a chemist, to understand and integrate. My main complaint is with the presentation. The speaker was so slow that I had to run all videos at 150% speed to keep from falling asleep. Though, since that was possible, it turns out his slow speaking wasn't really an inconvenience.",4
1987,An excellent course! Great teachers and content.,5
1988,"For a beginner like me, this course was a good introduction. I really liked the interviews of the earlier students who are now working in different role in different companies. That gave me a good insight about the working world in this field.",4
1989,The concepts that I learnt are very useful and interesting.,5
1990,This course is amazing! Very useful for students who are looking for data-driven position. Thanks for sharing.,5
1991,A very helpful course in understanding how business is run from an analytical point of view.,5
1992,"Sometimes it seems very ""mechanic"". The instructor is clearly reading a script.",3
1993,"I have zero business background and I found this course to be challenging enough that I learned something new, but it didn't take me that long to master the basics so I could starting talking about what I learned with my business-trained friends almost immediately.I did have to think carefully about the final assignment which was great for my learning. I also enjoyed marking other people's assignments and gaining new insights of the case from my fellow MOOC students.",5
1994,Great course. The instructor is very knowledgeable and gives lots of examples of real companies using metrics. There are some good assignments to practice using the things taught in the course. Seems like a good specialization too.,4
1995,"Well planned, relevant and fantastic course instructor!",5
1996,"This entry-level course provides a general understanding of data related job positions, companies, and industries. The difficulty of the course is suitable for those new to the data world.",4
1997,"Knowledge enriching course, transparent practical applications and wonderfully taught by Prof Egger !!",5
1998,"I thought it was brilliantly put together. It was easy to follow, but it was packed full of great information! I definitely feel like it was worth my time. Great class!",5
1999,"Very interesting introduction to the business intelligence, totally recommended.",4
2000,"This Course is simply awesome!Cutting edge insights into the data industry ,along with real time problems faced by the experts.You cannot go wrong with this one, HIT ENROLL NOW!!",5
2001,"great course, had great examples lots of good material",5
2002,I enjoyed this course very much. I also feel that I learned something. And I am looking forward to the next course in sequence. This is a highly unusual thing for me (and I do have a lot of graduate and post-graduate experience both at universities and online). Course organizers care about what we are learning and how we are getting there. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning business analytics and enjoying the process at the same time.,5
2003,This is a good course to understand the basics of business metrics in several different kind of companies.,5
2004,Perfect,5
2005,Good intro course with just enough info to get you ready to dive into the new Big Data world. Really enjoyed the side-videos with people in the field.,5
2006,"good preparation from the instructors, challenging quiz questions, most importantly, a lot of real world examples make it fun and apprehensible.",5
2007,Great course. Good insight on business analytics.,5
2008,"Great presentation, great explanation by Dr. Egger.",5
2009,Very good course. I just missed some materials to work with outside the course.,5
2010,"I found the lectures marginally useful. The instructor may know what he is talking about but takes a rather unstructured approach to articulating it. Having come from a business background and going into BI full-time, I was seeking novel ways to evaluate business performance. The glossary cheatsheets delivered on this best - but the videos I found to have simple, tired repeated perspective. It could be more useful if you have no business background whatsoever.",3
2011,"In my opinion this course is superficial. I didn't get real knowledge from it. At the same time this course might be just an intro to the series of courses about Business Analytics. So I'm looking forward to try them all!Anyway, thanks for the course!",3
2012,Loved the course :),5
2013,I love it!,5
2014,Great course for anyone new to Data mining,5
2015,Excellent foundation course; from understanding data in businesses to the fundamentals of the role functions that support these metrics. A+++++,5
2016,Very practical and useful,5
2017,Great baseline understanding of how to talk intelligently about business metrics.,5
2018,I love this course,5
2019,Excellent video presentations. Clearly explained and easy to understand.,5
2020,"Great lecturing style, light hearted yet cerebral. Superb.",5
2021,Spectacular contents and fantastic teaching method! Love this!,5
2022,Good mix between theory and practice.,4
2023,Love the course so far. Can't wait to get really good at this stuff and use it in my place of work!,5
2024,Good beginning course.,4
2025,"This is a very high level overview. I felt it was thourough, and the instructor was good. I wish there was a little more practice of concepts... But overall, wonderful!",5
2026,"This is probably the best coursera courrse I've ever taken for a few reasons. (1) I want to be a data scientist and he explains the best path to become one. (2) This is the most pragmatic online class I've taken since it focuses on what businesses do and what they really want. (3) Videos are short but very substantial.In short, it's the course giving me the most applicable knowledge and skills to use in business.",5
2027,Great course! But they don't provide weekly summary of content despite number of people have already requested this :)Would definitely suggest!,4
2028,"First course I've taken on Coursera, and I am impressed. I believe that the most important part of these MOOC's is to make sure that they seem useful and provide relevant information, and this course definitely delivered. In contrast to many of my university courses which are broad and quite honestly non-applicable to many work fields, this class was direct and to the point. I never felt as if a single minute was wasted on this course, and it was not difficult to finish this course because of that.",5
2029,"Pretty good course. Good professional speaker. But to common ,aterials.",4
2030,Very informative and easy to get into especially for someone who's not well-versed in business concepts.,5
2031,"Excellent! It is a new innovated era! This course gives an opportunity to leads in a multidimensional ""open and unlimited"" "" data space""! Unreservedly, Ι suggest it!",5
2032,"A great course all over! Last week is too difficult, but it worths the effort!",5
2033,"Best Online Course Available for SQL Beginner on Internet.Detailed, Equipped with Real Life Data and Analysis.Exceptional Training on MySQL & Teradata Tools.Power to change the Life of learner.",5
2034,very helpful!,5
2035,There are some typos in Week 5 Teradata exercise needed to be corrected,5
2036,"MySQL lessons, quizzes and assignments are very well organised and taught. But was not very happy with the Teradata part. Overall it was a very good course! Jana is a fantastic teacher.",5
2037,"What this course can improve is it should adopt the habit of thinking more instead of writing. Because in the week 5, the quiz is much more difficult than all the exercises we have done in previous weeks. And we don't have the guide step by step like previous weeks. I do know we have a week 5 quiz guide. However, when you write queries, sometimes, you do think your logic is right and query is right, why can't I get the same answer with the choices?And when I finish the quiz and look back to the answer, I even can't find the logic difference between answers and mine but the reality is I can't get the correct result. There is only one diff I have found in one specific question, that is, I didn't use the same format to define one constraint. But I do think my way is also fine and I also get an answer I think is totally correct from the logic.So I do suggest the answers should not be single sometimes, you should consider some specific formats or situation when students write their own queries. Don't give simple answer, give the reason why you are correct.",4
2038,The relational schema for the dognition database should have been provided.,4
2039,"Really bad course. Badly taught, strange choice of assignments and quiz questions. Unfortunately, I did the free trial and Coursera didn't process my cancellation so that I had to pay for a whole month for this.Complete waste of time AND(!!!) money!",1
2040,"Very useful and relevant. Able to get lots of practice with SQL in this course.However, this is an extremely difficult course.",5
2041,very helpful course,5
2042,thank you!,5
2043,"This is a really nice course to start learning SQL. It introduces the basic framework of correlation database and provides multiple case practices every week. The loading of this class is somehow larger than it is mentioned in the syllabus. So for those who want to learn SQL and willing to spend more than ten hours practicing every week, i strongly recommend this course :)",5
2044,"You get a lot of information and really need to invest some time but I highly recommend it, it includes many practical exercises.",5
2045,"Best course to start learning SQL & Jupyter Notebook (Python). I have already tried to learn SQL from CodeAcademy, but this one is much more intuitive & detail-oriented. Lots of easy-to-follow examples, great instructor and quality of videos/lectures. I recommend it 100%.",5
2046,Excellent MOOC. Ideal to get hands on experience with MySQL and Teradata working on real data bases. Great exercices and great professor. The last week is tough but rewar,5
2047,"great but a little bit complex, you could better learn the book first",4
2048,"Very difficult, but you will learn how to use SQL!",4
2049,It is hard but it is worthy,5
2050,It was fun and hard learning.,5
2051,Very Nice Course!,5
2052,"This is a great course that moves at a nice pace and allows students to experience SQL two different platforms (Jupyter, Teradata) with two different but interesting data sets. The videos are great but as with all programming the key is to practice, practice, practice! Which there is plenty of opportunity for also. Highly recommend.",5
2053,very good lessons with bund of materials to practice,5
2054,Great course! Very useful skill for business world. Professor explain the concept very carefully. The exercise are very helpful and challenged.,5
2055,The Teradata part is quite challenging and I think it would be better if there are more hints. I like the SQL part more.,4
2056,"I strongly recommend this course!Firstly, This course gives listeners great opportunities to get access to the real world data and the skills to retrieve the data that can be used for analyzing.Secondly, the design of this course is perfect, it includes almost all the necessary skills(queries, analyzing skills), resources(where you can find solutions when u come across problems) and tips for data analysis with sql.Thirdly, the teacher(Jana) is good. She shows us the comprehensive aspects of data analysis with clear structure and step by step.Therefore, it is good for beginners! One thing to mention is that if you are a beginner, you may need almost 18 hours every week under high efficiency especially for the last two weeks. Hence, it's good to make a balance !",5
2057,Super great learning experience!,5
2058,Excellent introduction to SQL if students take the extra time to do the optional exercises and really get comfortable with the SQL syntax and nuances. Engaging and also challenging.,5
2059,"handy tool to pull out data and analysis, but the learner themselves need to practice m",5
2060,Good introduction,4
2061,It doesn't go into great depth but exposes you enough to SQL to give you a good start and an appreciation of how complex company databases are likely to be.Works with real data.,5
2062,EXCELLENT COURSE@ EVERYTHING YOU NEED ABOUT SQL BEGINNER TO INTERMEDIATE USER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED.,5
2063,"Poor performance of Jupyter and the wildly underestimated time commitments really sunk this one for me. The latter, especially is inexcusable. The syllabus is lopsided and, while organized, not enough thought has been given to the exercise workload.",2
2064,"This course is great, finally that line in my resume is not a lie) I wish we went through this course on coursera back then in my university instead of SQL lessons that we had.I really apreciated the realistic setup for practice and rather big number of given exercises - very usefull for digestion of information. And by the way Jana is the best lecturer among all the ones I've seen on Coursera, very live, open, enthusiastic and giving information with structure and to the point. Thank you, it was a pleasure.",5
2065,awesome material and good lectures. Would recommend this course!!!,5
2066,"This course makes sure you learn MySQL in the most efficient way. I definitely recommend this course. Professor Jana is super awesome, I mean it. Thanks!",5
2067,"Awesome course, so clearly explained",5
2068,Challenging course with huge payoff in new skills gained!!!,5
2069,"A lot of work, but totally worth it. I definitely feel like this course does a great job of teaching applied SQL, rather than just teaching you syntax. Highly recommended.",5
2070,"My experience with Teradata has been awful. Connection issues, latency, time outs. What should have taken 45 minutes took nearly two hours because of the load times for datasets. No clock or indication of progression for the queries.",1
2071,"amazing and interesting course. I am a beginner in this field, by my experience, it is beginner friendly. I feel very lucky to take this course.",5
2072,To the point and with excellent real world data to train on your assignments,4
2073,"The notes are perfect! But I do think that the content might be a little bit easy.. Good course for beginners, but if you are looking for more challenges, this might not be the best choice for you.",4
2074,Excellent Course. Worth the efforts.,5
2075,It prov systematic training and practical tips to my current job.,5
2076,Perfect courses for people who have no experience in sql.,5
2077,quite useful. there are a bunch of exercises which are extremely helpful to help us get touch with real-world business cases.,5
2078,"I have done a number of courses on coursera. After this one, I am now also doing the Tableau course. I think it is fair to say that Jana provides great value. I have seen courses with very shallow content. Jana's are the opposite. It's actually a lot or work to get to the detailed assignments, but that's a good thing. I really get the feeling that I have learned something!",5
2079,It is a very good course to understand the basic fundamentals and applying them on actual database.,5
2080,Perfect for an introduction to SQL. Still a lot to learn but I certainly feel like a can learn it.,5
2081,reviewed. good course.,3
2082,"If you choose to follow this course, you will have to invest a lot of time. There are few videos, but you will go through a lot of exercises that will make you learn (or recall, like in my case) SQL in a very effective way.",5
2083,I learned SQL by doing projects at work but this SQL helps me to learn from very basic to the advanced. Some questions why this happened at work before was explained well in the class. That's true that data in the real world is messy and missing.,5
2084,"Highly recommend this course for people pursuing careers in data analysis/business intelligence - i.e. those who do not need to know the details of how to set up or optimize databases, but will interact with databases regularly to get data for their work.",5
2085,"Easy enough for a SQL newbie, meaty enough to be satisfying",5
2086,"I think this course if poorly organized. The instructor is really trying to show us that the real life data sets and databases are messy, but providing only written instructions for me it proved useless. I, for one, need to see what other people are doing and not read long pages of horrible written explanations.I paid for the course just to be able to do the exercises, which I also think it's a minus.All in all it didn't ""ENHANCE"" my career prospects, mostly because nothing useful was taught here. Wouldn't recommend anyone to pay for it.",1
2087,"This course provided a good introduction to SQL for me as a beginner and through challenging lessons forced me to learn SQL basics. After Week 3 however, I found that the level of difficulty increased steeply and not enough assistance was provided in the lessons to get through the course at a reasonable pace. In addition to providing answers to each week's exercises, further review of how the answer was obtained and the breakdown of the logic behind it would be helpful.",3
2088,Practical knowledge.,4
2089,Very Challenging course work!!,4
2090,As an introduction to SQL this course is great! Really enjoyed it!,5
2091,"Really good Course if you have the time to follow all the workshops and assignments, because they take quite a lot of time to complete, so allocate some extra time so you can learn properly, the good thing is that at the end you will have a solid understanding of SQL, Query’s and how to mine data for answers. Highly recommended for SQL starters.",4
2092,I really enjoyed the course and found it very useful. I can write a basic query now !! and I got a bit more understanding of how to work with databases. My only recommendation for the mentors is to work on more samples of queries using Teradata and add the answers to the week assignments. I'm still wondering a few answers and not sure if the output of my queries was the expected.,4
2093,Very good ! :) Learn a lot of SQL,5
2094,The course structure was well formatted. The order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive. The follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the student.However there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course. This made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries. It was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct. It would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set provided.Finally I think this course would be better split into two parts. The first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries. The main audience would be analyst/data professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data. The second part of the course would be more useful to DBAs or professionals that have database admin privileges to insert/delete/modify data. I would also focus more heavily on database schemas in this second course relative to the first.,3
2095,I would like thanks Jana and all of her colleagues who helped in providing this course. Since this course has much importance from job perspective. I would also like to thanks Coursera for providing me an opportunity.,5
2096,Very helpful!,5
2097,Great way to learn SQL querying and analysis strategies,5
2098,"very detailed introduction of SQL. The only thing is that there could be more videos introduce different functions instead of writing documents as materials. Other than that, it's a great class",5
2099,Really awesome course!!! I like it very much!,5
2100,"Very useful and well-designed course. Jana is an effective instructor with a great sense of humor. Her course material is easy at first and gradually gets harder, which is suited for students with no SQL background but eager to learn. But this course does require a lot of your time and dedication ---- Plan 5 hours every week and sometimes even more (week 4 and 5). It took me 2 rounds of enrollment to earn the certificate. All in all, I would recommend this course to people interested in data analytics, who want to update their knowledge beyond excel and have the time and the drive.",4
2101,This is an extremely well organized course with problems sufficiently challenging that the exercises really help one master the material.,5
2102,Best course I've ever taken on coursera because it's all about practice instead of theory - and the quizzes/practice questions are extremely difficult but once you get through it you will definitely say SQL is a skill you own.,5
2103,very practical and challengin which is goood,5
2104,"It's very practical but hard at the same time. I like the teaching style. What's makes me little uncomfortable is that the teradata system guidance is kind of obscure. However, the Jupiter guidance is really yummy. Hope to learn more sql applications in the future.",4
2105,Great course - very clear and it provides good insights and interesting challenges/ tests,5
2106,"there are so little video tutorials, and too many exercises without video instructions.",3
2107,It's an amazing course. The final assignment is quite challenging but fun. All in all a very rewarding and satisfying course.,5
2108,Cool. Tough but cool.,5
2109,"Brilliant course for the beginner to learn SQL. Well structured, very thorough and making use of some great technological resources for the user to practice their SQL with. By Week 4 my SQL had improved significantly and I was applying what I'd learned in my job . The final week is very challenging though, so be prepared to give it plenty of time.",5
2110,"I you are absolutely new to SQL, I couldn't recommend a better course. Its a wonderful course to take, good explanations and excellent practice opportunities with real databases. The program goes beyond just writing SQL queries but help you to understand the way databases are organized, and it teaches you how to right queries from an analytical perspective.",5
2111,"Difficult, but well worth it. I feel so much more confident in tackling SQL now!",5
2112,wonderful course for beginner,5
2113,Great Course! Covers everything you need in great detail.,5
2114,It was an Awesome course. Really enjoyed doing all the exercises. Now I feel quite confident to write any queries.Special Thanks to Professor Jana Schaich Borg for teaching so wonderfully!!!!!,5
2115,Amazing course!,5
2116,Very usefull,5
2117,nice course for me to better understand how to master the sql,4
2118,The exercises and quizzes (particularly the teradata sets) were difficult enough that you have to think and structure your approach to arrive at the right solution. Very good learning curve.,5
2119,"This course takes longer time than I expected but the practices are concrete, well-designed, and therefore helpful.",5
2120,"Overall, great course!I have approached other courses from other platforms and the upsides of this one here are many. The involvement of the teachers in this course is incredible in my opinion and they help a lot. The number of exercises also seems appropriate so overall the experience was great.I definitely advise the instructors to suggest at least part of the answers to the practice exercises of week 5 (in Teradata). The gap between week 3 and 4 is a lot bigger than between week 2 and 3, of course, which is normal. Nevertheless, week 5 seems a bit like a detached exercise. I realize this must have been done for educational purposes but my instinct tells me that if I were provided with more indication I would have gone later to the discussion forums which I reckon would have been beneficial to my learning experience.That was, in my opinion, a significant drawback but in general the course is so great I would not like to pull its rating back, so I leave 5*.Thank you!",5
2121,If you can finish this course you will be more then efficient in SQL.,5
2122,Very complete and up to the point! Lots of useful resources!,4
2123,Unprecedented high speaking speed.,1
2124,"This was one of the best courses I've ever taken. Each lesson built on its predecessor logically. I worked hard to learn each of the concepts, but was very impressed by how much I had learned by the end of the course.",5
2125,Week 3 is unrealistically difficult,4
2126,Title's a bit confusing. The course isn't exactly about managing BigData.,4
2127,It is really useful class.,5
2128,The actual amount of time required per week to complete the course was well over the 3-5 hours/week advertised on the course homepage. It was a very time intensive activity each week- especially the last 2 weeks.,4
2129,This is an excellent course indeed. Access to real world data is a huge +. Some of the questions in the quizzes were difficult though. And also the witty jokes by the Prof... :):),5
2130,Difficult but very useful course,4
2131,Excellent course !! Teradata experience is a bonus on this excellent MySQL program. Highly recommended to anyone who needs to learn big data SQL.,5
2132,I personally found this course useful. Adding dognition database to make students feel of real database is a great plus.,5
2133,One of the best courses taken! I have learned so much from practices provided by the instructor!,5
2134,"phenomenal ipython notebook exercises! really well thought out and coherent with the tableau course. goes much deeper than other online SQL courses, problem sets can be hard",5
2135,This is by far the most comprehensive SQL course I have ever taken. A lot of times there are SQL classes that are online that give you a glimpse into what it takes to be great at SQL queries. This is a must for anyone seriously considering to becoming a data analyst.,5
2136,it is as great as i think,5
2137,"The course should be longer, prepare yourself you are going to need a lot of time, unless you have previous experience from SQL. It'll take maybe even more than one session. But it is worth it, because it covers all skills you need for working with SQL. If you really need to learn SQL, there is no better option.",4
2138,"This course is too much doggy! Please do not use Coursera for advertising your friends´companies, or at least learn how to do it a little more professionally to look really relevant! This psychiatric lady also seems to be sexits. Looking at differences between pictures with a girl and pictures with a boy is really abominable and shows an intentional discrimination and racism. It is really shameful.",1
2139,"Course was well conducted and explained, however, the final test was quite long and challenging.",4
2140,Great course for beginners :),5
2141,Perfect course,5
2142,I enjoy it . It's very useful for the beginner,5
2143,"One of the most amazing MOOC courses I have ever taken. From the start, Jana did an excellent job with building the intuition of databases in general and of SQL. The modules (weeks) are organized coherently. The datasets were realistic and challenging (in a great way).The best aspect of this course is the MySQL exercises, built upon IPython notebook. Personally I have experience with R and Python, yet I still feel like I learned a lot from the exercises. The instructions and lessons as part of the programming exercise were clear and useful, effectively complementing the video lectures and providing hands-on experiences.The only pity I have is that Coursera stopped providing full access to course materials and Statement of Accomplishment. But that has nothing to do with this course. The instructors seem to provided maximal opportunity for all students, including ones (like me ) who are just 'auditing'.Overall, a five star rating is a must for this course.",5
2144,Really helpful course with great instructor! I ejoyed it alot!,5
2145,Great! I love it!,5
2146,The course is very well calibrated. You move step by step from easy SQL queries to pretty complex ones. The connection to the business value of the queries you write is also explained in a convincing way.,5
2147,"Great content, good practice using real-world business data.",4
2148,Really useful and practical course. The exercises and quizes are the best in all the courses I've taken.,5
2149,"In-depth, I really enjoyed it.",5
2150,Great course until the end. The professor really understand the concept of teaching,5
2151,"Good introduction course to MySQL. Hope they includes how to import data, create table and update information too!",5
2152,"Great, hands-on course!",5
2153,work with real industry data is so much fun!,4
2154,Very helpful,5
2155,This course is the greatest ever made !,5
2156,"Great Course, Fun, and Practical. Love it!",5
2157,Amazing course and the quizzes are challenging. Learned a lot. Gives hands on experience on mysql and Teradata.,5
2158,The exercises are very well designed.,5
2159,It is a well-organized course. I really learnt a lot from the course. And the assignment and exercise work as a good practice for me to put what I learnt in the course into use.,5
2160,I wish there was a financial support for full enrollment at this course. but still GREAT course to experience.,5
2161,"It's pretty good for entry-level SQL learners. However, to further improve, much time is required. Also, exercises provided are sometimes really weird.",4
2162,I enhanced my programming knowledge for data retrival,5
2163,Great class to start learning SQL. Jupyter and Teradata are brilliant choices (web-based interface) that avoid the plain of installation. Real datasets from Dognition and Dillard make exercises much more meaningful. Thank you for the careful design and teaching!,5
2164,Very informative course！ Jena is very inspiring!,5
2165,"Great Course, especially since it's using real (and messy) data. Week 5 quiz gets quite challenging. Some more video lectures would be great.",5
2166,"I found the first 4 weeks of the course amazing: just really well structured, thought-out, and delivered in a way that positions the student for success. Jana breaks the material down into digestible bits, gives you sufficient practice, and even if you don't get it, you can look at the answers to the practice questions and figure out where your thinking was incorrect.The 5th week wasn't as well broken down, especially the last set of Teradata exercises. New concepts or ways of structuring queries were being introduced in those exercises, but there was no way to check for a correct solution if I couldn't come with one on my own (which was unfortunately half of the time). I still got a good grade on my last quiz, but I can't say that I really truly learned how to write the more complicated queries.I would suggest that the last Teradata exercise set has more explanation or perhaps just answers that the student can refer to in order to understand why his/her line of thinking isn't working.Otherwise, a truly fantastic course. I 100% recommend it.",5
2167,"The exercises , quizzes and videos are well planned and help understand the course material.",5
2168,Amazing Course. Learned a lot. A bit tough with exercises but was very helpful. Thank you for everything.,5
2169,Exercises are super challenging. But challenging oneself with difficult tasks is the best way to learn. Its a course worth going for.,5
2170,"Excellent introduction to SQL. Good, short overview of theoretical background. Lots of practice exercises.",5
2171,Excellent course for learning the query side of SQL!,5
2172,not easy but valiable course,5
2173,Challenging course going from very basic to quite complex SQL queries. Definitely recommended. The only downside are the repetitive technical issues.,4
2174,"Errors in the material made it difficult to get through. All past discussions on the forum are gone, making it difficult to review posts by classmates.",2
2175,Enjoyed every aspect.,5
2176,Learned a lot !,5
2177,"A lot of work, but valuable training.",5
2178,"The lectures are great, and the exercises are challenging to stimulate stronger learning.",5
2179,solid course with vivid learning structure for sql learner of various levels,5
2180,Switching between platforms was confusing but overall the course was good value for money,4
2181,Learn MySQL and Teradata in one course. Lots of hands on work and help for assignments. The only way I actually learn something. Just do it. I have a SQL server background and had to experience life without CTEs.,5
2182,Professor is great; exercises very effective and useful. Great class!,5
2183,Great starter course for MySQL and how to use SQL techniques in multiple databases. This is a great course for understanding and applying data pulls for business purposes.,5
2184,Awesome Course,5
2185,The most important and well designed Course I have ever done!,5
2186,Much needed Sql help,5
2187,"Great course, a little hard",4
2188,"This is a great course, one of the better ones in the series.",5
2189,"The technical support of this course is just terrible: just like many many other students (see the Discussion forums), I have experienced serious difficulties to access the databases platforms we need to learn and to complete our assignments. I can only echo the innumerable complains from my co-students about the lack of efficient support and technical reliability of this course; many of us are very unhappy about this, especially as they have paid for this course ... and what is Coursera doing about it, by the way?My advice: beware before enrolling in this course and even in this entire specialization, and search for alternative options (there are many, not only on Coursera but also on EdX and others ...)!!!",1
2190,"Very good, detailed course, I can recommend! Before that I knew nothing about SQL, now I have moved to higher level of analyst. Sometimes the instructions are not 100% clear, but it is minor problem.",4
2191,"I love this course design, very thoughtful and instructive!! Especially having the real database to practise from, it is great for beginners like myself!",5
2192,Derived attribute was never conveyed in the videos. So kindly add up the concept of derived attribute.,4
2193,learned a lot about basic queries,5
2194,"One of the best MOOC courses out there! Challenging but you will learn a lot if you stick with it. Extensive and in-depth lectures/practice exercises on SQL. Appreciate that you learn using two systems, MySQL (through Jupyter) and Teradata. However the Teradata interface is a bit clunky and takes time getting used to.BTW, Jana is a great instructor and Duke courses, in this track, especially the Tableau and MySQL courses are the best out there at the moment.",5
2195,Great course.. well explained,5
2196,"Its a very good class to learn to use SQL in a systematic manner, even if you had used SQL or are completely new. The two Databases ( Terradata and Dognition) gave a lot of valuable practice.",4
2197,Very helpful!,5
2198,great course.. only thing is answers to teradata exercises were not provided. So student cannot know whether he is writing correct sql statements,4
2199,Great class to learn SQL! Great learning how to use two different platforms and applying real world applications with queries.,5
2200,Enjoyed the course.The exercised are well-designed. Good way to start MySQL !,5
2201,"The video instruction are not as helpful as I wished. They were too brief, and all the learning end up with doing the exercises. The regular exercises and the quizzes use different database system, and it sometimes hard to transfer what you learn to the quizzes.The pre-quiz exercises are more helpful imo, but no answer key is provided. Sometimes I am still confused even after passing the quiz.",3
2202,"That was a very useful and interesting class! Presenter did a great job, and her materials were very use helpful and relevant!",5
2203,Big challenge with even bigger reward!!,5
2204,"Great, great, great course. Interactive and engaging. Relevant and focused. This is the future of learning!",5
2205,Very useful:) Very good explained for the begginers:),5
2206,"Challenging, but very informative!",5
2207,"Good material but heavy work-load, especially since we are learning two new skills -SQL syntax and Data analysis. Request instructors/TA's to guide students more in the forums. Analysis like computing avg daily revenue should be explained better as I spent too much time figuring it out and the forum answers were way off. However, this being an online class I was very impressed with the detailed worksheets in MYSQL.",4
2208,equipped with modern tools and practical experience,5
2209,It's a good class and I learned a lot. The learning curve shoots up exponentially around the fourth week. I could see this course being perfect if broken down into two classes.,3
2210,The course is very thorough but i woul have loved it if you had a way for instructors to better reach out to classmates rather than leave things to chance and everyone is confused for month. But either way the experience is priceless. Would recommend it to anyone,4
2211,I love the practice exercises!,4
2212,too many issues with the DB's that needed to be accessed to complete the exams.,3
2213,"If you work with data this is an excellent course, but even if you are not a frequent data user you can learn a lot from the logic it explains. I absolutely recommend it.",5
2214,"I have a theoretical background in relational algebra and SQL. This course did a great job of actually applying that theory in practice in the form of business situations. By using real life data, it also accurately presented raw data as not perfectly organized or ""clean"". Filtering with subqueries, IN, WHERE, and OUTER JOIN statements are absolutely crucial in cleaning data in real life situations; this course did an excellent job of demonstrating that importance.I have 2 interrelated critiques however: The usage of 2 different platforms (MySQL for the exercises and Teradata for the quizzes) was very confusing given their distinct syntaxes. I think it would have been more powerful to have the exercises and quizzes on the same platform. Furthermore, the Teradata platform was oftentimes overwhelmed by the number of users and frequently crashed. Going forward I would recommend either ensuring that the servers can handle the amount of user-load, or switching over to the MySQL platform entirely.",4
2215,I can confidently say that I KNOW SQL! Thank you professor.,5
2216,Awesome Experience.,5
2217,Perfect to know the basics to manage SQL data.,5
2218,"The course instruction is very good. If the Teradata database is improved, the course will deserve 5 star.",4
2219,Nice web pages to test the knowledge.,4
2220,It is a great course! There are plenty of online assignments to practice.,5
2221,It was one of the most efficient courses I have ever taken. Thank you very much. I learnt a lot from all excercises.,5
2222,very high quality materials and experiment design.Thank for teacher's great effort!,5
2223,"This course should be divided in 2 o be longer for two main reasons:1) Weeks are way too long to cover all the material, plus the research you need to do outside the platform. The time required end up being too much.2) The course is not deep enough - There's just too much topic to cover, and because of time constrains there are a lot of holes in your education at the end.For this two reason is better con get 2 courses about this topic. That way you can go deeper in to the SQL explanation, and can get at thee same time a better understanding of each topic, instead of getting a lot of thing to cope in just one week.",4
2224,Thank you. It was good course.,5
2225,"Fantastic course on SQL for those with no prior exposure. Also addresses basic database structures, relational schemas, and ER diagrams, providing an excellent foundation for further work with data in relational databases.",5
2226,"This course really gives you a taste of what it is to work with real-company data. I strongly recommend it if you want to master at MySQL. Previously I had done a lot of small courses on web pages such as Codeacademy, but this was so far the most complete one. At the end of the course you will be amazed by the thinh you will be capable to do!",5
2227,"It is very interesting, but we have to face problems with Teradata, I have not been able even to log in, and a lot of students are in the same situation, and the problem persists, even in the duedate of the test.",1
2228,Getting to learn Teradata was a bonus. Great class.,5
2229,The instructor is careful to include real world working experience in our learning which makes this course especially interesting and valuable.,5
2230,"great videos, great tutorials. Felt like I learnt this way better than any module I took in college because lectures were kept to the point, no long winding stories that goes on and on, assignments were manageable and easy to follow. Felt like I learnt at least 90% of everything that was taught, instead of a ~~50-60% usually.",5
2231,"easy to understand, wonderful!",5
2232,I really learned a lot! But it's hard and requires huge amount of time to master.,5
2233,It is a quite difficult course but very intresting!,5
2234,Great Course,5
2235,"Really like this course!! With abundant exercises, detailed explanation, real-world data and sweeeeet professor, it is a good start for SQL beginner!",5
2236,Very well structured and easy to follow. Very effective.,5
2237,It's hard but very useful!,5
2238,"quit a tough course, but worth your handwork",5
2239,Useful skill to keep. Jana is well prepared for each course. My company uses other softwares so there are some difference in syntax.,5
2240,"This course is really awesome!There are a lot of well designed exercises, which not only trained my skill to write SQL query but also deepen my understanding of relational database. The real business data provides learners an opportunity to get in touch with the real business world.So I am excited to recommend you to take this course. If you are a new beginner at MySQL, it can help you get started soon. If you already know some basic knowledge about SQL, this course will also be a good resource for practice.",5
2241,"great course. great example databases. i would suggest renaming the course Managing Big Data with MySQL and TeraData. The Teradata component of the course was very heavy, and all graded pieces of the course used Teradata.I would also make the assignments graded --- they can be peer reviewed. I think doing the assignments really help, not just completing the quizzes. those are my thoughts.",5
2242,"Great course! It takes you from zero knowledge of SQL to being able to write quite complicated queries, and being ready for most of standard SQL questions in job interviews. Strongly recommended!",5
2243,Great course great tools. Interesting and useful!,5
2244,"It is one of the best course I have taken. I am really enjoying my progress and it's simple and easy to learn. So, I recommend, if anyone interested in Big Data it is worth taking this Course and You get some confidence to go deeper.Big Thanks to Jana. You are such a Wonderful instructor.Cheers....Vishnu",5
2245,Nice course and I am impressed,5
2246,"Very good course for learning SQL - the tutorials, materials and exercises provided are very well thought and structured. The staff put lot of effort and thinking into this one. I like the whole specialization and I can recommend taking it.",5
2247,"I'm still in Week 1, but I'm already in love with this course. They give accurate information in a light manner, the exercises are very clear and didactic, and they also give the answers to these exercises which answers all of your potentially uprising questions, alongside with the Video Lectures. It is already giving me the confidence that it will be a great asset to me as a Data Analyst.",5
2248,It is very useful by covering all related aspect in information seeking.,5
2249,An excellent course: it provides learners with the concepts and skills necessary for searching and researching information in libraries and online. Lectures are clear and well organized. There are activities for students to go deeper into the topics (optional) and quizzes that helped them to check the main concepts.,5
2250,"Excellent, and important to investigation and intellectual working",5
2251,it is Avery good course and provide lots of information about searching process and tool of management,5
2252,Objective. Very good material and good practices to help you better build a bibliography for research purpose. Sometimes the multiple answers quiz can be tricky.,4
2253,"Not too comprehensive, but an overall good course.",4
2254,I have important knowledge and skill finding information through this couse.,4
2255,Perfect guided course. The only handicap to me is the accent of the speaking English. I hardly understand what they are saying without subtitles.Thx for your all precious effort.,1
2256,"I love this course. It helps me with my teaching and personal development. Besides, I know several reference management tools from this course. Storing the documents is really complicated and makes me in a mess. Thank you for your tutoring and sharing.",5
2257,"This course is very thorough and detailed. As an IT specialist, I have had no exposure to formal research and needed to understand the process. Now I can clearly and confidently say that I can perform good research and obtain formal information and data on any topic, as opposed to just surfing the internet for genuine knowledge. Great course, well done to the instructors.",5
2258,Very informative and interesting. I find that the exercises did not contribute enough to understanding the material.,4
2259,I learned a lot!,4
2260,Very useful for university students or people who new to research world,5
2261,This is a course that everyone need to pass it,5
2262,Very useful and handy tips.,4
2263,concise and stright to the point,5
2264,it is so cool course,5
2265,very informative and well organized.,5
2266,Wonderful course on information seeking.,5
2267,very useful!!,5
2268,As an experienced researcher I learned a lot from doing this course,5
2269,"Very interesting course, better done when in an academic context and with an ongoing project to carry out the exercices for. If you don't have access to a university library, you will be very limited, but the course presents some alternatives for us professionals who are still interested in researching and documenting our work with a more scientific approach.",4
2270,"The reading material is not good (it' s even bad) , but the course videos are excellent.",5
2271,"Like they say in the course for bachelor students, this is very helpful. I study history, so I always and up with millions of sources. Not only have I learned how to search intelligently, I have also learned to manage my results and papers carefully.",4
2272,"Apart for some slightly confusing breaks in the sentences for some speakers, it was very good and relevant information.",4
2273,I thought this was a great course on learning how drugs affect the brain. Everyone who has dealt with someone addicted to drugs should watch this. It gives you a better idea of what people are going through.,5
2274,"Very satisfied with the quality of the information. Thank you teacher, thank you Emory, and thank you Coursera. Lic. Rodrigo M. Álvarez.",5
2275,"Really good, detailed deep learning! Thank you",5
2276,Very good course. Opened a window to the world of addiction.,5
2277,I learnt so much about addiction and what it does to the brain...I wish I known this since I was a teen. I have been sharing my learning with my family and friends and looking forward to helping my community in this aspect. Thank you ever so much for such valuable AND LIFE SAVING INFORMATION!,5
2278,Detailed information in an easy to understand format.,5
2279,"This course is truly wonderful, many intellectual mind-opening surprises... for example I almost fell out of my chair when I learned of vaccinations development effort to counter addiction.",5
2280,"The Addicted Brain provided me the foundation to have the conviction to be at the frontier of a community owned initiative to help the Philippines War on Drugs. The Harm Reduction Principle is the applied principle with Magnesium Mineral as agent for detoxification to address SAWS. As a Naturopath Doctor, I have been using Minerals in treating variety of ailments of my patients. Among these minerals is an End Stage Renal Failure case for dialysis which was cleared ""NO DIALYSIS NEEDED"" by his Physician after his Minerals Therapy. Others are symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Syndrome due to other health conditions such as Insomnia, Depression, Involuntary Muscle Movement, Muscles Pain, Anxiety, Brain Fog, Pins and Needles, and others.The Addicted Brain Course is a must course for those who are working in the field of Drug Addiction.",5
2281,"This course is an amplified knowledge basket that can settle in any person who is directly or indirectly affected of substance addiction or abuse. It is great to have available this kind of courses, highly recommended.",5
2282,Learned so much and so interesting.,5
2283,Very informative . However somebody needs to give this instructor a glass of water :},5
2284,"Quite boring, a lot of propaganda against drugs. Sometimes data is presented in misleading ways to make the harm from drugs look greater. Though if you are new to the topic, you may consider to take the course as it contains some useful information.",2
2285,"Very informative, though I would recommend getting a little background on how the brain works in general, it will help you get more out of this course.",5
2286,Did not like that I have to upgrade just to take a quiz,3
2287,Excellent content!! The professor was eloquent and very clear.,5
2288,"Information strays between ridiculously shallow and unnecessarily deep (e.g. the stuff about GPCRs is so far removed from importance when discussing addiction). Most of the time the questions are poorly worded and thoughtless, and the whole thing reminds me of a bad high school class. Some parts border on misinformation, does seem almost as if it's been underwritten by the DEA. Paints a very distinct picture, a picture with an agenda and really incomplete portrayal of addiction. Points for trying though.",2
2289,I enjoyed this course all the way. It was challenging for me and extremely educative. The knowledge accrued is already in use.,5
2290,"Very well-presented course with excellent illustrations. Gives a good overview on addiction with pharmacology, with good links to further reading. I found the title slightly misleading though, as the course presented very little information on brain physiology except for the dopamine receptors.",4
2291,"Great course, wish if it was focused more on the glutamate and dopamine roles in addiction and relapse. thank you",4
2292,The course is useful but I hoped that it would cover the area of treatment better than that.,5
2293,Concise and very informative for all those who want to understand this epidemic health issue called addiction.,5
2294,excellent course I found it very informative :-,5
2295,"This course was particularly helpful and explanatory to someone like me, who has little knowledge of the processes of substances in the human brain and the effects of drugs in general. I enjoyed almost every lecture's content and the way the whole course was structured. However, I do think that the way the lectures were delivered was a bit dry and that more perspectives on the drug addiction issue could have been presented.",4
2296,Interesting overview. The teacher is clear and competent. Lacks opinion of differents sources,4
2297,A wonderful and enlightening course with clear and precise explanations on how does a drug influenced brain function. The course also looks into human and animal behaviour and the nature of addiction and motivation. I recommend it to anyone interested in the matter.,5
2298,Its all you would want from the course. Informative and efficient.,4
2299,A great overview of relevant material and a well negotiated outline of how harm reduction can positively impact longterm drug abuse.,4
2300,very interesting,5
2301,This course is very clarifying and informative. The lecturer is charismatic and didactic.,5
2302,Very informative,4
2303,"The information was great. My only complaint would be how dry the lectures were, and I do not meant the content, I meant the delivery.",4
2304,The instructor was great. The material was very informative and interesting. Highly recommend.,5
2305,very informative,5
2306,A real pleasure to learn!,5
2307,"This is a very well structured, very well explained course. It gives an original insight into the workings of the human mind, and how substances can impact it in various ways.",5
2308,Great! Thank you very much for these classes!,5
2309,I found this course well structured and concise. It covered a lot of the subject with up to date information. It had helpful diagrams and gave good real life examples. Highly recommend for everyone to help understand substance misuse and possible treatments. Also it's role in the wider society.,5
2310,"The instructor for this class is pretty boring, but do really like the course itself",4
2311,this is very informative coures,4
2312,"To the point, very appealing and the professor I amazing! I have been getting so much useful information and details about the brain of addicts.",5
2313,great course. so easy to follow the very clear teaching. interesting material.,5
2314,Unable to even start it... Click on videos of week 1 and nothing happens,1
2315,"The course taught me a lot about how brain gets addicted, What happens in our body after taking drugs, why the test and screen for drugs designed in particular way, etc.",5
2316,Worth skimming fast through for free to learn a little something about the brain. Don't expect to learn much about the brain though. The title is a little misleading.,3
2317,Helped me understand why my left my family for a life of meth addiction. I am thankful that it has reduced my stress and anger ove3 what she has done. even a small amount of understanding,5
2318,loved it I learned a lot,5
2319,"Well, I expected more and more debt, It seems the course is oriented to the general public.",3
2320,"The course satisfied me in various aspects. It is brief and clear. Thank you for our instructor for nice presentations.Nevertheless, I would expect more about pharma and treatment apporaches. More about drugs available in the markets and new trends.Psychotherapy applications / demonstrations would be very useful.",3
2321,"Thank you for this course, professor Kuhar. I really appreciate the organization and the contents. I appreciate your deeply interest for this subject.",5
2322,"Very comprehensive but easy to follow. I only regret the ""pro animal testing"" proselytism here and there.",4
2323,It was so helpful to understanding addiction,5
2324,I am a graduate student of counseling. This course added a dimension to my coursework and future career that was both needed and very much appreciated. Ideas are broken-down into understandable portions. It is helpful to have some knowledge of how neurons work and terms associated therein.,5
2325,very boring and didn't learn anything i didn't already know. this was more like watching an anti drug propaganda film that I couldn't finish it.,1
2326,good lectures,5
2327,This was a fabulous training. Very eye-opening.,5
2328,Knowledgeable professor. Distracting background. I prefer direct eye contact rather than having the professor sometimes filmed not looking directly at the camera. But the course gave excellent information and I enjoyed it.,3
2329,"Great course with a good overview of subject.Mr. Kuhar is a great speaker, easy to understand and very calm.",5
2330,"Very good course, but some external links are no longer working",5
2331,This was very informative and right on the mark with how society feels and what is available in the lines of treatment/help.Thank you.,4
2332,Very useful and interesting,5
2333,"Course give very good information, but the ""The addicted brain"" its not the correct name.Second part of the course give more detail information about different drugs and body biology, but its not directly related to the Brain.However, the training its very good, just change the label.",3
2334,"very interesting, and mind opening. Very clear and easy to follow lecturesI enjoyed this course very much",5
2335,"Great course and was put out very well, never felt like I was in over my head.",5
2336,Very informative if you're new to the study of Addiction or already familiar tons of great useful information!,5
2337,Excellent course in an easy to use format. Very enjoyable and informative. Resources and video lectures are of a very high standard.,5
2338,One of the finest courses of the Coursera. The topic is interesting as to how certain release of chemical neurotransmitter is involved in day to day life factors . The experiments and scanning of the brain imaging techniques show how the brain responds in various factors like how a drug addicted brain differs from the normal brain in metabolism. Interesting,5
2339,"yeah i would give zero if possible. very shallow and general, cannot learn much from it. if u want a course about neuroscience there's way better course than this. what the hell emory? what hte hell coursera? i feel less and less sincerity in coursera's mooc these days. edx is doing a much better job in my perspective.",1
2340,"While providing some knowledge about drugs and drug-addiction, I would have preferred a more in-depth guide into the inner workings of the brain related to drugs. Nevertheless it served as a good introduction to addiction.",4
2341,"So simple, not enough informative.",3
2342,"I recently graduated with an MSW. I concentrated my course load on children and found addiction knowledge to be lacking upon graduation. Too many families are affected by addiction and in good conscience I couldn't work with children and their families without learning more. This was extremely helpful and the course gave me more passion and knowledge concerning children and addiction in terms of vulnerability, prevention, risk and protective factors. The instructor was wonderful, non-judgmental and very informative. I loved the neurobiology explanations as well. Thank you!!!",5
2343,"i love this course, becuase i have learned more then i really though i would in frist place.thankz ever soo much",5
2344,"This course is very helpful. I have kept learning this course and completed the quiz. It helps me understand the mechanism of the addiction, what is dopamine and how it works, the class of the illicit drugs, the animal self-administration model and what can I learn from the animal experiment, the vulnerability for addiction, and risk and protective factors of addiction, neuroimaging studies of addiction. Most of all, I have a better understanding of addiction. The pronunciation of the Professor is so clear and helps me to improve my English. Thanks very much. I enjoy it.",5
2345,great course,5
2346,Very interesting material presented in a clear manner. Great instruction and interesting substance.,5
2347,"If possible, I would give this course zero stars. It provides an incredibly closed minded view towards all topics and provides very minimal factual information. The makers of this course, and especially the instructor, obviously have had very little to no experience of any kind with most of the topics they discuss.",1
2348,"I found the course to be very informative. I volunteer in the Drug Courts and work with Homeless and Ex-felons, many of whom have substance abuse and co-occurring issues. The information in this class, will greatly help me in my work.",5
2349,Excellent introductory course. It is very useful that it can be completed at the student's own pace.,5
2350,"I am very interested in this topic however I found the instructor's presentation to be so monotonic and slow paced that I dropped out. I am sure he knows his material cold and I am sure that he is much better ""live"" in class. The readings were appropriate and the course out line solid. However this is not his media. And I have done the ""talking to the camera"" thing and it can be deadly for presenters. It is not BTW an ""age thing""; I am older than he, I am sure, and do not ask that presentations be entertaining - just that they be engaging. (Perhaps if Coursera had lecturers present in front of small groups, as ""Great Courses"" does? It is unfortunate that (as I understand it) Coursera doesn't offer a ""free look"" with the option to transfer one's fee to another course if unhappy. Hope this is constructive for both the lecturer and Coursera.",2
2351,"A fun, informative course with a lot of information about various addictions, the science thereof, and their impact on society. Highly recommended to all.",5
2352,I learned a lot in this course. I thought the rat experiments were very interesting and revealing.,4
2353,I was very enjoyed participating this course.,5
2354,"This course is very useful, practical and very easy to understand. It has really given me new insights into the disease of addiction.",5
2355,Very informati,5
2356,Excellently presented course. Very informative. Some really good recommended links to read along side the course context. Well thought out.,5
2357,Maybe too easy... And too focused on the society more than on the brain itself. Enjoyed it though.,3
2358,Excellent insight into how we become addicts. Encourages further research.,5
2359,This course was extremely informative and easy to understand. I feel that,5
2360,Very interesting,5
2361,I found this course to be very enriching in understanding the physiological reasons why the person addicted acts and thinks in a peculiar way and also very enlightening as to why the relapse is so frequent in recovering addicts,5
2362,This course is fundamental for understand or remember about drugs,5
2363,"Great course, very interesting and clear. I was drinking the talk (it is a french expression :-) )",5
2364,So easy to understand; taught with compassion and real understanding of addiction.,5
2365,The instructor presented the material in a very clear and compassionate way. The spee,5
2366,"The content was great, the presentation was a bit dry, but I feel I got a lot out of this course.",4
2367,An excellent course which covers the scientific and qualitative aspects of drugs addiction and physical dependency.,5
2368,Fascinating course,5
2369,"Excellent course, very interesting and with a very good teching method.",5
2370,Very informative.,4
2371,"Addiction is not only about smoking and alcohol and drugs, its way way beyond that and thanks to Dr. Michael Kuhar and the Emory university for revealing it to me.",5
2372,It's an excellent course!!! I love the instructor's style.,5
2373,"Very informative course, well structure and easy to follow.",5
2374,Well-structured and very factual. Also many resources made available for further learning.,4
2375,"well, since i got stocked with my university homework, i couldn't get the chance to finish this course as i was expecting to. but, definitely i would like to let you know that this has been an amazing journey for me, an ADHD who is obligated to be on ritalin so that the society gets comfortable around me. although it never made me feel better about myself, but it made people around me to stop complaining about my energy. after all, i am still an addict to this pill, but at the end, thanks to Emory University guys, i succeeded to know my body and what it goes through when i tend to not be ADHD. i have never got to reach the treatment parts, but at least i'm going to give a lecture on the side effects of ritalin in university.at the end, thanks, for letting us know. that was the best gift ever :)",5
2376,"As a career dieter who is constantly reading about causes of obesity, I can't say I learned anything too earth-shattering. However, the research discussed does support what I have learned from listening to the podcasts from the Institute for the Psychology of Eating.",2
2377,"Feels underwritten by the DEA, and aimed at perhaps high school students? Very slow pace; info could've been distilled into less than half the lectures (I completed the '7 weeks' in 3 days). Doesn't really distinguish between users without serious problems & addicts (which I believe amplifies gateway effects & experimentation once people meet users who aren't brain damaged or addicts). Creates an exaggerated and arbitrary distinction between prescribed drugs as all good and recreational as all bad, and dismisses any possible benefits of substances that are not legal, noting only that medical marijuana has been helpful for HIV patients, which is certainly an understatement. Components are also helpful for cancer patients, anxiety, and more. Perhaps break this into studies of common drugs, how they work, & effects and separately, the mechanisms of addiction and treatment. However, I appreciated the 'reduce harm' policy economics.",1
2378,Interesting but really introductive,3
2379,Fairly interesting course. I learned quite a bit I can say from taking this class. Some of the content seemed irrelevant. But overall a great course!,4
2380,"This course was beyond informative. I too have been exposed to those afflicted by addiction and am to deal with it on a daily basis with those whom are in life even now. The information taught in an ""Easy To Learn"" manner by Dr. Kuhar was incredible. I now understand the functioning of an ""Addicts"" brain much more thoroughly. I'm grateful this course was a presentation in which I was honored to be able to be a participant.",5
2381,"This is an excellent way of to understand,",4
2382,"The course gives you a new vision in several ways, some of them: the addictions are related to alterations in brain function given by neurotrasmamisores as is more chronic drug use in the brain damage is reflected in general. Another very important point policy to reduce the harm allows an opportunity for these people, not only reduces the social and personal costs, but overall health, so too for drug courts. And the work to avoid .estigma for people addicted.I was invited to read and study about it, and learn more. Thank you very much to all the team at Coursera, congratulations to Dr. Michel H.",5
2383,excellent course.wanted more!!!!!,5
2384,This is a very good introductory course on the various aspects of addiction. I wish they would introduce a second part with more comprehensive information.,4
2385,Thank you for your great lectures! I really learned a lot from this course. :),5
2386,"It is a short, but multidisciplinary course, that covers all the problematics about drug addiction.",5
2387,"Maybe because I am a med graduate already I expected much more from this course. It was ok, but my impression was always like there was too much of talking what important stuff is going to be discussed, but not really the facts themselves. I would rather learn more practical knowledge. Anyway I learnt some new things as well.",3
2388,really good and practical course,5
2389,"This is a very interesting course. Some of the material is pretty difficult, but it is presented in a clear manner. I learned a lot from the professor.",4
2390,A great and informative course. Very clear and interesting! I would have appreciated a bit more if it discussed more tips to help prevent/deal-with drug abuse or addiction. Thank you for the course!,4
2391,Good course. But a little too easy for psychology majors.,5
2392,"An extreamly interesting and enlightening course. The instructor, professor Kuhar, is an incredible lecturer with very pleasurable voice and amicable attitude. The topics of drugs and addiction is discussed on many levels, from phisiology to societal changes. I would certainly recommend this course to anyone who wish to better understand the problem of addiction because of either personal reasons or academic interest.",5
2393,"Great course. I liked the deadline notification option. I also liked the opportunity to complete work at my own pace with the final deadline the end of the course. With my busy schedule, this option was wonderful and allowed me to complete all of the assignments for credit.",5
2394,"Very insightful, although some of the assignments were a bit easy. Perhaps we could have a discussion of the 'rat park' experiments and maybe even the possibility that some drugs can be used for recreational use?",5
2395,Very interesting as lay person interested in topic.,3
2396,Very good trip !,5
2397,"Very interesting and comprehensive. Very helpful and exhaustive data, corroborated from various fields of knowledge. Thank you very much!",5
2398,"Excellent. I enjoyed the lectures, and the material was, for the most part, very enlightening and interesting.",5
2399,Very interesting course,5
2400,"Really disappointing course. Content is shallow, despite the impressive credentials of the Professor. Quizzes are ridiculously easy.",1
2401,A great insight into the addicted brain and what can be done about it all. A great broad introduction into drug addiction and the brain.,4
2402,Thank you very much Professor for your excellent course...,5
2403,"So far, very educational , would appreciate if the videos would be little more discriptive",4
2404,"The individual course topics were evenly distributed and presented in a meticulous, thorough, as well as elaborate manner. The lecturer was inviting and encouraging, whereas the technical specifications of the video lectures and quizzes were exceptionally good. In overall, the ''Addicted Brain'' course positively predisposes me towards opting for more courses provided and sponsored by the Emory University.",5
2405,Really enjoyed this course very informative,5
2406,"Highly rated course.A very good choice for youngs and seniors with addiction or not. Very important to prevent addictive trends and to help addicted people, because Dr Michael KUHAR explains very clearly and very simply with a choice of experiment and other examples, complex brain behaviors. Thank you to Emory University and to Coursera too.",5
2407,Very easy and fun. Videos are fantastic.,5
2408,"I did this course last year, since I had psychological knowledge so it was not too hard to understand all the concepts. What really attracts me is the forum, I just tried to post my question about assignment at forum, then quickly got a reply from my peer, from then on, I started to participate on forum discussion and did learn a lot. So, come to join us!",5
2409,Excellent course! Professor is enthusiastic about the subject and conveys this to the students. Great course for grappling with the issues created by addiction.,5
2410,Short and very understandable lectures. Very interesting topic and the professor is very good and a master on this topic. No need for background on neuroscience since the professor explains everything very well.,5
2411,"Real interesting and useful course, but since it's not my major, though sometimes hard for me to understand some concept. Still quite good! Nice teacher!",4
2412,"A great course approaching many aspects of addiction, both behavioral studies as well neurosciences aspects.",5
2413,"Very good and intresting subject, well organized.",5
2414,I found both the course content and the Professor very engaging and thorough. I appreciated the methodical manner the scientific content was provided and the visuals were absolutely key to helping me to completely grasp.,5
2415,very useful & I enjoy it !,5
2416,"Somewhat too simple, but still a good basic introduction.",3
2417,Very informative. Thoroughly enjoyed both the class and the teacher.,5
2418,Fantastic review of the brain and the effects of harmful substances. Thank you.,5
2419,"Briefly introduce some concepts of the drug use and some in neuroscience, a good introduction course.",4
2420,"As a trainee lawyer I found this course quite good and helpful.In Portugal we have a lot of drug issues. Knowing how drug addiction works in the human brain might be helpful, especially on court, where some individuals are convicted for drug issues when, sometimes, it's not only their choice.Thank you for the course. I hope there are more courses available for this kind of issues.",5
2421,"Not very informative, and too simple. Also, there is way too much repeating",2
2422,Very interesting,5
2423,"Great course. It could have been a little more dense with technical information, but it was excellent for a broad overview of the topic.",4
2424,Very informative and down-to-earth. Accessible by academic types and ordinary folks.,5
2425,"Very good introduction to why people become addicts. Key points are learnt are our brains are wired to be addicted, addiction is a brain disease and needs to be seen and treated as such and that coffee which i drink everyday is a drug!",4
2426,"I like very much this class, I've learned a lot, and is very usefull for my career! Thanks",5
2427,I am absolutely loving this course. The lecturer is extremely thorough in his explanations. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity. 😊,5
2428,Learnt a lot !,5
2429,Interesting and mind-opening course. Enjoying it!,5
2430,Well designed course. I have a couple of close family members who are addicts...pills and gambling. I highly recommend this class. The professor is excellent and I've benefited from his lectures.,4
2431,"I enjoyed the material and flow of topics presented. I did have some trouble getting a few of the videos to load in the module on Neurotransmission (week 5), which was unfortunate. Very interesting, thanks!",4
2432,"I learned some important concepts, but all of the material was repeated many times. If the redundancy of information were eliminated, imagine how much more students of this course could learn!",3
2433,Very well presented and incredibly interesting,5
2434,"It was informative but felt that the instructor was somehow too confident of his position, though he did give lip service to other positions. I am not sure why this bothered me, since I agree with the importance of being compassionate and the misguidedness of a punitive stance towards addiction. And in fact, it has nothing to do with the course. I would also have enjoyed seeing more and/or more detailed case studies.",4
2435,"The course gives a very comprehensive overview of what drugs are and how it affects the brain, as well as practical advice for person and government. It addresses the issue in a scientific but simple way, that makes people really understand what we are dealing with, especially with the concept of comorbidity.",4
2436,Excellent. Great -- and timely information. Nicely done.,5
2437,Very clear and organized materials.,4
2438,Enjoyed every minute. Very educative. Thank you.,5
2439,Exciting. It is clear and informative.,5
2440,amazing and easy to learn and really really great teacher,5
2441,I will rated number 3 because I want to learn more new stuff about protections of my body.,3
2442,Interesting to say the leastWhy cant i access my certificate. I paid and successfully passed,1
2443,Very good teacher!,5
2444,This is a useful basic refresher course for anyone who works or volunteers in the substance abuse field. I wanted to know the latest brain research and get an update on the various drug categories.,4
2445,"Very comprehensive on all aspects on drug addiction, though a bit too difficult for those without any medical or biological background knowledge. More animations / diagrams for illustration would make the course better.",4
2446,Great course into the physiological aspects of addiction and brain psychology. Please have expand the course.,4
2447,"Excellent and interesting course on a very important topic. Very professional production and high quality lectures. It was quite easy, apart from the brain chemistry sections.",5
2448,Great contribution to healthy humanity.,4
2449,Excellent!!! Very clear!,5
2450,"i love the addicted brain course it teachs you so many cool things about drugs,neurotransmitters,how then drugs affect the body.",5
2451,Very informative but very dry presentations.,2
2452,this is an amazing course and there is a lot to learn. the course director took his time to explain things for even a layman to understant. Perfect course with perfect lectures. I loved every aspect of it.,5
2453,The lecturer explains the facts really good and determined! as someone who English is her second language it is really easy to understand the material.,5
2454,Awsome course,5
2455,The course content has rigor and the learning is great!! Thanks,5
2456,"Not bad, some tests are too difficult, specially to understand the right questions. Materials are good but some details make the expereince not so good. However, overall is a good course!",4
2457,"Excellent course - If you want to internalise and understand course content and tools, it requires more time than estimate written in course outline.",5
2458,I am a working professional in the field of data analytics where in Tableau is one of the application we use it on a daily basis. My motive for taking this course is to learn some more innovative techniques that are used by professionals in tableau but the fact was there is nothing new for me to learn here in terms of techniques. I would say this course suits best for a beginner but not for someone who already has some lineage with tableau.Pros:1. Hourglass model is one of the things I liked the most.2. Final project submission is really challenging and which help me to learn lot of new things.Cons:1. Weekly tests are very lengthy2. Every once can get 100% not a big deal by trial and error3. Most of the questions in the weekly course are very subjective and cannot have a single correct answer. We had to retake the test again and again to get 100% due to subjective questionsHowever this course has definitely changed my way of looking into data and the way we decipher it. I am looking forward to continue and take more coursers to be a the part of this esteemed analytics community.,4
2459,Excellent Explanation. Flow of teaching is very clear.,5
2460,Excellent introductory course of Tableau !!,5
2461,Very Resourceful.,5
2462,The more complex functions in Tableau could be explained better.,4
2463,Good Course for Introductory Tableau Visualization.,4
2464,Really interesting even if a little complex at times,4
2465,Good course for basic learning Tableau,5
2466,Great class that gives you not just an intro to Tableau but takes you through to becoming an intermediate level user! I highly recommend it if this is the field you're looking to enter or the skill you want to add to your resume,5
2467,It is a good start for us to learn Tableau. But I think the video instruction is not so clear.,4
2468,"excellent content and final assessment giving a nice funny challenge, well done to the team!",4
2469,I just think that there could be more assistance with respect to the practice exercises :) otherwise the lectures by Jana were absolutely terrific :),4
2470,"The instructor has masterfully convey the materials and carefully craft the course materials, hence the course is both easy to follow and enjoyable. The content are also very relevant to practical industry use.",5
2471,Great Learning Experience,5
2472,BEST COURSE FOR ANALYTICS PERSON.,5
2473,Not enough Tableau use for it to be in the title of the course,3
2474,"The Best Course!, Thanks Coursera & Duke University",5
2475,The best course!,5
2476,An intense course but you will be confident in Tableau than ever before once you complete..The professor has made the course as interesting and knowledge rich as she can!!,5
2477,Great course with lots of practical advices and tips for how to carry a visualization analytic project from beginning to end!,5
2478,Very good and level of difficulty is just right.,5
2479,"It was really good course designed for professionals as well as associative with academy. Jana has really presented everything well. Also, thanks to coursera for providing me this course.",5
2480,"It is a nice course, practical, recommendable. A little bit demanding. Because the dedicated time is upper than theorical time. Good cases. Congratulations!",5
2481,Great course!!,5
2482,"great class, i learned a lot",5
2483,good course for tableau and effective communication.,4
2484,"Very interesting course! Its very helpful if you need to grab, analyse and visualize your data. Thanks!",5
2485,"Great experience. Really fun and exciting to work with real data and trying to solve a real business problem. The teacher was really clear in her presentantions and you can cleary see the effort she and the whole team made in the creation of this course. This was my favorite, and probably the harder course I had take on Coursera.",5
2486,Tableau course is very worth learning because the Tableau's visualisation method is quite different from Excel. The final project is time and effort demanding but it is a wonderful chance to utilise what you have learned during the course. One thing I didn't not enjoying about this course is the forum is not quite organised and there is a few support/ response from the instructor/ mentors like the other online classes.,5
2487,"Very steep learning curve switching from the videos and lectures to the final assignment. But enjoyed the challenge. Relevant links to learn specific topics on the tool would have been helpful. Interesting data sets to work with (Salary & Dognition) and challenging problem statement. If the intention is to learn Tableau as a tool then I would not recommend this course. Part of my expectation was this also, hence only 4 stars.",4
2488,This is one of the best courses i have taken ever.,5
2489,"Both Challenging & rewarding, taught me basics of Tableau, viz and comms.",4
2490,So far it has been brilliant. So lucid!,5
2491,Unprecedented high speaking speed.,1
2492,"This is a pretty basic introduction to Tableau, but the skills introduced here are exactly what you need to get started. I",5
2493,"This is one of the best courses I have ever taken. It is fun and yet, it is very detailed and, yes, it takes a bit more than 2-3 hours per week.You will learn much more than using Tableau. You will learn to ask the right questions and you will also learn how to present your data analytics results to the C-suite or whoever asked for it.I highly recommend this to anyone, beginners and experienced business / data analysts.",5
2494,"There needs to be more help available, at least for paying students, to answer questions and clear misunderstanding. The quizzes are taking too much time.",1
2495,I learned a lot from this course. I may even be able to get a tableau certification as a result!,5
2496,"The instructor is very informative, and the course material is just excellent!",5
2497,Great course! This course is not just teaching you how to operate with Tableau. It's more important that you can learn how to link your data with your business problem and help people to make better decision.,5
2498,perfect course for a beginner to get acquainted with tableau tool.,5
2499,"well designed and impressive courses! I learn a lot about Tableau technique and the whole process of data analysis, including preparing the data analysis process with scientific guidance, making persuasive illustration and giving a high quality presentation!! I have learned a lot!",5
2500,Very comprehensive and clear content delivery. Usable and helpful learning tools,4
2501,Excellent Course!!! Enjoy the learning experience!!! Highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Tableau. Good Luck.,5
2502,Great introduction and lessons regarding Tableau.,5
2503,"awesome tool, teaches you how to think like a data scientist",4
2504,Good course,5
2505,"Excellent course, well presentedGood JobLuca",5
2506,"I really enjoy this Course the Explanations and Utilization of Tableau are the best, I really recomend this to anyone interest in Data Analysis or that need to work with a lot of data in their daily activities.",5
2507,Very good course! Open you mind for fast a appealing visualisation of data and turning it into insights.,5
2508,"I will start with you do learn a lot from the videos (and the stuff you learn is very valuable), it's the absence of staff or professor involvement that is a problem and why I am not giving 5 stars. Outside of quizzes which are graded by computers, your ""practice"" assignments (which aren't practice because you can't check your answers before a test, super awesome when you can't really ask for help), final project and forum questions are graded or answered by other students.If you have any confusion, either it will go unresolved or be worsened by potentially wrong answers from other students which I saw happen many, many times. Maybe I am expecting too much from an online learning platform? In all, I feel like while I did learn, I perhaps learned some wrong practices too. So while the videos are great, the actual teacher involvement is poor.Coursera - I am not sure how you and the university work together, but is it totally strange to desire some input from your professor?",3
2509,A great course from Business Analytics point of view.,4
2510,"Best course of the specialization so far, you can tell the instructor specializes in engaging presentations. I felt like I was never lost, but always challenged.",5
2511,Great course and extremely helpful professor! Love it!,5
2512,"The videos are great! Much less math-heavy than the Excel Course in this series, so it was a nice break.",5
2513,"Excellent course! The videos are easy to follow along, and Dr. Borg is great at explaining the material. Also, it was fun to learn how to use Tableau, and develop a thorough understanding of the program. Highly recommend this course if you are interested in data analytics, data visualization, and/or business presentations.",5
2514,Great course!,5
2515,Great Course highly recommended!,5
2516,"The course was well built-up, the presentations were extremely clear and there was a great combination between listening and actual examples that you had to do yourself.",5
2517,Awesome course. Easy to understand and useful tools. Thank you so much for providing me this course! :),5
2518,"Thanks very much for great content and especially, Ms. Jana Schaich Borg for brilliant presentation skills, lovely voice and good looking as well. Please participate. This is highly recommend course.",5
2519,"very useful, especially the final project. I do learn a lot from this course.",5
2520,I enjoyed learning this course. It's not only fun but also gives very detailed tutorial by using Tableau. This course gives me a practical learning experience and business orientated way of thinking by utilizing the Data Visualization.,5
2521,"The flow and presentation was very engaging. This will give you a relatively basic overview of tableau with mention of higher functionality. ""Poking the box"" is going to be a lot easier having taken this course.",5
2522,Interesting and useful so far,5
2523,Very good course,5
2524,Loved the Tableau section and the instructor is a good communicator. It'd be great to have a whole course about this BI Software,4
2525,"This is an excellent course. You are given a six month license to use Tableau as well as practice data for the assignments and exercises. It is very practical and informative. It covers more than just Tableau. The first week is about framing data questions and working with stakeholders. The second and third week cover Tableau. The last week gives some very helpful tips for giving effective presentations. The final assessment will go over all of these things, so be prepared to put them to use if you want the final certificate.",5
2526,You will be impress about how this course . Yo will enjoy high level of Educational Material .,5
2527,"Absolutely outstanding course. It stretched me - late nights grappling with the data, learning Tableau, recording a blooper-free presentation. So many takes!But this course was not just about Tableau; it was about clarifying goals, planning before diving into the data, putting yourself in the shoes of the client and good presentation principles. Great practical exercise at the end - make sure you put aside plenty of time for this.",5
2528,Could've learnt this on youtube - really not very good. Dr. Egger's courses are rigorous and full of math. This is just a bunch of pretty pictures. Shouldn't be included in this specialization.,1
2529,very useful in terms of providing an intro to Tableau and how to use the application,5
2530,it was an awesome course. One of the best I attended from Coursera.,4
2531,Best course from Duke's data analysis specialisation. Hands-on experience and real data to work with.,5
2532,"Prof. Jana S. Borg is the simply the best! Every lecture material (videos/exercises/final project) is carefully crafted to optimize student's learning experience. She's made the learning fun and that's not easy to do!Now, let's talk about the reason why I didn't give this course a full 5-star rating.... It's the students! As you might already know, this class requires us to put together a 5-minute screencast video that will demonstrate our understanding in 1) Tableau, 2) Business Analytics and 3) Presentation skills. Unfortunately, most of the students only care about the first one while blatantly ignoring the other two. And that makes the grading process a pain in the..errr.... you know what!Another important reminder. Be sure to submit the final project days before the deadline. Otherwise, you might be at risk of not getting graded by 3 other students! On the forum, a student claimed that she was forced to join this session because she couldn't get 3 peers to grade her project TWO SESSIONS ago! The horror!",4
2533,"It is a great course to understand how to use Tableau. Learning through this, I could utilize Tableau for real business case my company is facing to.",5
2534,Great course with strong material on how to create an excellent presentation and use Tableau.,4
2535,"I loved this course. The lecture videos taught me a lot and I was happy I got to use whatever I learned in the final project. The only reason why I'm giving three stars was because of the submission process for the final project. It gave me a headache because I didn't really understand how to submit to Tableau public. I tried following the instructions but I couldn't find some things so it confused me a bit. It caused me to submit my assignment late, and it was just not a pleasant process. Maybe upload new instructions with screenshots, or make another lecture video on how to submit.",3
2536,I have given an extra star for the free license software received.Didn't find the course as challenging as the Machine Learning course.The assignments need to be more challenging. Connecting to SQlite / GA Analytics dummy data can be added. Tableau with R session can be incorporated.,3
2537,A very good broad introduction to Tableau.,5
2538,I think it is excellent that you start the course with understanding the business value and stakeholders for analyzing the data.,5
2539,Very nice and eye-opening class. Jena presented very well. I have learnt a lot from this class. Thank you Jena!,5
2540,"Nice alternative to Tableau's webinars. While not necessary for certification, handy for real world application.",5
2541,The instructor provided a data set from an actual business to use in the Tableau analysis. I felt that the videos and supplemental information provided valuable instruction on data analysis in the Tableau software and the communication of the results. This was a great class.,5
2542,"Love Tableau. Very challenging class, but if you make it you will know how to use Tableau.",5
2543,"There's a lot of great information in this course and it's presented in a very good way. However, like the excel course in this specialization, most of the material isn't about using Tableau. 1 week is about running a project, 2 weeks are about using Tableau, and the final 2 weeks are about presentation. If you're interest isn't mainly in Tableau, I would recommend the course. However, if you're taking this course to learn Tableau, I would suggest not paying for it.",2
2544,The course was marvelous. It helped me a lot in the Tableau learning process and improved my graphic communication abillities.,5
2545,I have loved this course and the videos have been amazing. This course has been fantastic for getting a foundation in understanding data analysis and the use of Tableau!,4
2546,This is a great course! Just what I need! Thank you Jana!,5
2547,Well-written exercises that really force you to get it. Plus you get a 6-month license so you can keep playing around with Tableau once you've finished the course.,5
2548,Amazing course with good start up,4
2549,Great course that is applicable to ALL professions and is especially important to young professionals that are looking for a leg up in the work-place.,5
2550,"Excellent course, well presented.Very useful tips which I will probably return to later in my career.",4
2551,"Excellent course! The instructor is very clear and to the point. The exercises are challenging, fun and require a little bit of digging in that just takes the learning to a whole new level. A very rewarding experience.",5
2552,Very interesting and interactive course.,5
2553,"I found the class very easy to follow, yet informative and truly helpful.",5
2554,"Great course!Very well organized, and worked in a format where you would build as you learned and had several milestones for review.The one complaint I have is that the final asks for you to work in Tableau, and provides you a license for 15 days, although the course runs longer than that.",3
2555,Great class. Clear layout. Learned a lot.,5
2556,Great course! Very useful and given by an excellent professor! I love Tableau! Made my work easier and better looking.,5
2557,Very helpful content with easy-to-understand explanations that I can follow along. Jana is also engaging instructor. Tableau Desktop key provided is huge help as well.,5
2558,Great class,5
2559,Well design but no help from mentor site,5
2560,Very good. The teacher is awesome!,5
2561,"Best course I have taken in Coursera until now, entertaining, all-rounded and containing interesting and highly relevant lessons-- I feel like a Tableau power user already :)",5
2562,"Excellent class to learn to visualize data using Tableau, I feel a lot more confident about using Tableau and its features. The final exam project was excellent. On a constructive note-- I wish they had a couple more videos or Pdf guides to format a presentation.Well done Instructors",4
2563,"One of the best courses on Coursera: the content covers not just the usage of Tableau but also the objectives heading into using Tableau as well as the presentation of the results one gets from Tableau. Most of all, it is evident that the trainers know their stuff and had a lot of fun putting this together!",5
2564,very useful!,5
2565,"This course may be misleading aspiring data analysts and scientists: it may give the false impression that, with the tools learned here, you will be able to analyze your data by yourself. In fact, you would be completely missing on large chapters of statistics and, as a result, you would often end up drawing wrong conclusions and believe you did a great job. For example, what is the point of giving you a single 10-minutes video on how to do regression in Tableau if you don't even know regression (which is AT LEAST a one-term course in graduate school, and only after several other prior basic stats courses)? BEWARE: get a much larger background in statistics before applying anything you learn here in real life. Some minimal stats knowledge should be recommended as a pre-requisite for this course, or else you end up doing like those monkeys using a statistical software without really understanding what they are doing and drawing conclusions with blissful ignorance. The problem is: some of your audience will know and will notice, more often than you might think and you will end up looking like an idiot.Sorry to be negative here, but I think I owe you, my co-student, at least a warning: do learn more stats elsewhere!! ... good luck.",2
2566,really good one.... best course on visualization.,5
2567,"That was a very useful and interesting class! Presenter did a great job, and her materials were very use helpful and relevant!",5
2568,"Its a good course, but I feel too much details in week 3 course content.",4
2569,Excellent. Very interesting and useful for my job.,5
2570,Awesome course and best instructor.,5
2571,Its Been a great course.,5
2572,Awesome course!,4
2573,It is a great course. The examples show the Tableau possibilities in an easy way.,5
2574,Love the instructor giving tips on how to make compelling presentations in addition to teaching technical aspect of Tableau.,5
2575,Good course and very nice demonstrations on Tableau.,4
2576,Interesting,4
2577,"Excellent course. Love the content and the delivery. Also, the project is super cute!",5
2578,"This is an excellent class that covers basic data analysis and visualization with Tableau, but more importantly covers how to approach data analysis and how to present the results of a data analysis to a business audience (i.e., management executives). I would recommend this class for anybody starting in this space, or anybody who feels that their analysis is not coming through to decision-makers in their organization.",5
2579,great introduction to using Tableau (if you're like me and never used it). Jana gives an excellent lecture (never boring or mono-toned).,5
2580,"Thanks a lot, Jana Borg! One of the most interesting and useful courses.",5
2581,The course explains basics of using Tableau as on approach for data visualization very well. I particularly liked this course for teaching me the basic presentation skills and expressing them through tableau. The final project allows you to showcase the learnt skills. Thanks everyone !!!,5
2582,Excellent courseThank you Jana and Duke team,5
2583,"Well organized, taught and presented. Thank you!",5
2584,Great for those starting out getting their hands wet with a FREE copy of Tableau!,4
2585,"Fantastic course. Clear, insightful instruction. No prior experience with Tableau needed. Not only is the software taught, but topics like how to address a business analysis problem in a logical manner are addressed as well.",5
2586,Well made course!Thank you,5
2587,Relevant introduction to get productive with Tableau quickly. Clear examples with the ability to apply immediately with a temporary student license to Tableau.,5
2588,I loved this course! Amazing!,5
2589,"Jana Schaich Borg takes extra care to provide and share knowledge and methodology that is useful to any person who is keen on data analyst role to be competent in data exploration, analysis and presentation using Tableau data visualisation tool.I have learned and benefited greatly from such course.",5
2590,Very useful and entertaining,5
2591,Very engaging course. Great introduction to Tableau and general presentation tips. Real application of data analysis and Tableau with a real data set and problem needing recommendations,5
2592,"Really polished videos, really thorough explanations of how to do everything, really great overview of different functionalities that gave us a good balance of breadth and depth. Fantastic course.",5
2593,"Awesome class - very well organized, great examples, challenging assignments, and includes interviews with real data analysts and data scientists! Got me hooked on Tableau and am now working on implementing it at work.",5
2594,One of the best courses I've gone through. Excellent presentation skills by the trainer and great practical tips to present effectively. Learnt a lot about Tableau through this course. Thanks!,5
2595,Tableau is garbage and their assignment practice questions don't work,1
2596,Very well structured and easy to follow. Very nice teacher,5
2597,"The material is very interesting with well-made videos. Great course to get an introduction to Tableau.The downside for me was that some videos were rushed with as they had too much content, and quizzes could be much better, I found the questions not really up-to-par with the course content.",4
2598,"Amazing course, teaches a well rounded experience with Tableau and considerations for data visualization. Great professors!",5
2599,Excellent Course!The Quiz is quite challenging but really useful. All the exercises are well designed to guid you step by step to not only learn tableau software but also form an intuition of analyze real business data.I indeed recommend you fellows taking this course! It will be beneficial.,5
2600,Great,5
2601,It's is easy and precise anybody can learn quickly with some basic knowledge about computers. Thanks Jana for your efforts.,5
2602,Quite helpful,4
2603,"I really enjoyed the lectures. The introduction to Tableau was broad enough to get a feel for possibilities and gave plenty of resources to further look for guidance as needed. In addition, the focus was not just on the technical tool but relaying the differences in visualization for analysis and visualization for persuasion. I enjoyed her lecturing and felt like the visual science and very specific actionable takeaways were good.",5
2604,"I have being using Tableau for the last 5 months. Though I could consider myself strong in visualization, it is clear after taking the first two weeks of this course that I was utterly poor in analysis. Thank you for this powerful course. Whether you are familiar with Tableau or not, this is a course worthy all your time.",5
2605,Awesome course!,5
2606,Good explanation !,5
2607,Awesome! I love how Ms. Jana keeps you pepped up and makes the learning interesting. Thank you!,5
2608,"Really great course! Very well organized, material is engaging and really well presented.Covers everything you need to know to get started with Tableau (hands on!). If you already work with Tableau, will be quite easy for you to complete the course, but you may still learn a few cool tricks from Jana.I also really liked the first week of the course where Jana went over the general concepts of being a good data analyst. They aren't shocking or extremely eye opening, but nonetheless it is very important to truly understand. I found it interesting the way she presented them.Great job with the course! Most engaging course I personally tried on Coursera so far :)",5
2609,excellent choice of visualization software. would have loved if more of the functions were explored,5
2610,"simply amazing , accessible and complete",5
2611,Very complete,5
2612,Very well thought and structured.,5
2613,Such a cool Program. I've immediately used it in my place of work.,5
2614,Great training using a terrific dataset. Learned some best practices and frameworks too.,4
2615,"One of, if not the best MOOC I have taken",5
2616,"The video presentation at the end isn't what I would expect/want from an online course. I stopped short of the final project, but the course was otherwise useful.",4
2617,Great class!,5
2618,The course content is itself interesting but the lack of active mentors to provide guidance makes the course really difficult to learn. So many unanswered questions on the discussion board and many confused students. I am so glad I am not paying for this course.,1
2619,Useful Tableau tips and visualization recommendations.Instructor videos are accelerated most of the time so the speech sounds unnatural and sometimes difficult to understand.,4
2620,"Immediately applicable to the workplace. The learn at your own pace style is great for those with more rigid work schedules, and the lectures are a fantastic resource. I wholeheartedly recommend this course!",5
2621,very nice course especially week 1 is amazing,5
2622,intense but great learning,5
2623,Very good teachers/instructors.,5
2624,There is a gap between the instruction level and the difficulty of quizzes and final projects.,1
2625,"Interesting, loved the teacher.",4
2626,"interesting lectures, real project using the tools presented in the course, and you get all the basic functions of Tableau for granted! good job!",5
2627,Incredibly content packed course. The best one of this series.,5
2628,"Good brush on Tableau. Great that the course included a 6 mo license to Tableau Desktop!However while more complex topics where touched, they were rushed also. An extra week or two at the more advanced stuff would've been beneficial. Some of the quizzes also were a bit silly and focusing on minor things.",4
2629,Exciting course.,4
2630,Nice course if anyone wants to learn Tableau. Practise exercises & Quizes are relevant. It would be nice if solutions are provided for both the practise excersies and the quizes.,4
2631,Really useful class,5
2632,good introduction course for this tool.,5
2633,"Very well taught course about using Tableau, providing tableau license for the Specialization (6 months). The lectures are well executed, concepts well explained and referenced materials provided. The most fun part are the assignments using real world datasets by Dognition. The course introduced me to very interesting visualization tool used in Data analytics. I enjoyed this course and took a great deal out of it.",5
2634,"Great course, very comprehensive but in the other hand challenging to keep you engaged in learning and self discover about your ""real"" data samples.I'll continue with the specialization, thanks Duke University.",4
2635,Good class but could do with a bit more explanation of the Tableau features,4
2636,"Not perfect, but overall pretty good. No support from instructor or teaching assistants in the course forums.",4
2637,"Really liked the course. Very well designed and carried away. The only thing I wasn't too happy was the final project as the data was not easy to understand. As a beginner when we have to focus more on Tableau related features, I ended up spending more time understanding the data which didn't really help me. Otherwise, it was a good course. Surely, it put me on a fast track for Tableau.",4
2638,Good syllabus and challenging assignments with real data. Great lecturer too.,4
2639,Teaches the basics of Tableau along with the business concepts. A perfect way to pick up new skills.,5
2640,Outstanding Course!,5
2641,Good course,5
2642,On extraordinary course that introduce you to effective communication with a powerful tool such as Tableau.,5
2643,Excellent! The instructor did a great job!,5
2644,The videos are very clear and easy to grasp knowledge. Way much better than data analysis with excel course.,5
2645,Great course. The course material is very useful in helping you understand the use of tableau and best practices used for visualizations.,5
2646,Great introduction to Data Visualization!,5
2647,A great course that brings real life scenarios and applications to determine the use in Tableau in the industry.,5
2648,"Awesome course for those who wish to learn Tableau. Real-life project / dataset , in-depth exercises and a free 6-month license for Tableau desktop makes it extremely easy to practice, play and get expertise with both data analysis and Tableau software. The tips and resources for giving great presentations are like icing on the cake!i've taken 10+ classes on Coursera and this is definitely one of the best!Thank you Duke univ and coursera! :)",5
2649,Good videos well presented. Good intro into data viz and Tableau,4
2650,I would simply recommend this course for anyone who wants to become a Great Business Analyst. Simply sequential and All-Interesting...,5
2651,brilliant! Thank you!,5
2652,Just starting week 3 and I've already learned a ton about approaching data visualizations while leveraging Tableau. This course does an excellent job of demystifying the beautiful and powerful tool that is Tableau. Even after only a week or so of playing around on Tableau I feel fairly comfortable in using it in my own work.,5
2653,"Great course. Very informative. I am a marine biologist, but we also struggle with the same type of problems in properly presenting our data in effective and engaging ways. This course is very helpful in giving ideas on how to do this better. I also introduced me to new software in Tableau which is pretty impressive. But it is yet another program to try and learn which may be a deterrent to some.",4
2654,"Professor is engaging and I am happy there are so many video lectures, it is really nice and you feel you are genuinely progressing. Quizzes are very tough though and this course requires a lot of dedication and some frequent repeats of the videos to understand the material.",4
2655,Excellent Course. Great learning,5
2656,"Nice class! Even though I got a ms degree in stat, I still enjoy it. The first week is important when you apply data analysis in the real world. And you can learn to build those fabulous tables in tableau in the following weeks. Great class!",5
2657,Nice course..good example and hand on assignments.,5
2658,"Great course, helped me to move from a basic user to intermediate in Tableau",5
2659,This course is engaging and full of great resources. Everything taught in the course can be applied to positively impact your ability to tell compelling stories with data.,5
2660,Good content! Thoughtful insight on approaching problem solving in data analysis world.,5
2661,"wonderful design of content, good business examples.",5
2662,Very interesting and very useful course ;-),5
2663,Wonderful class,5
2664,This course is very helpful for me. Thanks Professor so much !,5
2665,I have moved from zero to building my first App for operations in my office just after week one. I advice that you go through the labs. It will cement your understanding and bring all to practical and implementation terms. Good luck.,5
2666,thank you,5
2667,"Online grader for labs is terribly buggy. Attempted submitting labs several occasions - all fail. Local builds work fine with apps working as expected and tests pass. The online builder gives very little feedback other than ""BuidError"". £40 wasted. Will not recommend and will never fall for it again. AVOID!",1
2668,"It's a good course by the standards of when it was made which, going by the overview, looks like 2014. the lectures are based on eclipse while the video teaches how to install android studio. Some of the examples are not compatible with Android studio and work only on eclipse. Being updated with the more recent material would've helped more. Having said that, the teaching style is really conducive to learning for newbies. It's a good introduction to the world of Android development.",3
2669,i liked the materiel that was discussed in this course. really good !!,5
2670,"I learnt a lot in this class. It was always something I wanted to accomplish. I learnt that you must have a lot of memory and hard drive space on your PC to run the emulator I also think that the new studio, Android Studio is better than Eclipse. I loved the forums because they solved most of the problems I had. I would like the instructors and mentors to answer questions in a timely manner.",4
2671,Good Course,5
2672,Well done for newcomers,5
2673,the course is a bit outdated and I am finding it hard to stay motivated knowing there are other more recent courses. The topics I think are still relevant but the tools are not. I am looking for courses where there is hands on development that you follow with the instructor and I did not find this here.,2
2674,Good introduction to Android programming.,5
2675,"Excellent course, excellent teacher. Enjoyed the course.",5
2676,"It's a great course, really is, but there are some weeks (4th week for instance) with a overwhelming amount of content, leaving few hours to study and even fewer to conclude the exercises.",4
2677,"Outdated and unsupported !The code for the exercises was made for Eclipse ADT and Google dropped support for Eclipse a while ago. The official IDE for Android development is Android Studio now.I could import the project for Lab1 but I'm unable to compile the tests and the program with Android Studio, I get a ton of errors. My post in the forums about this is unanswered for 3 days now.",1
2678,Very nice and well organised. Enjoyed a lot. Thanks a lot. Very Helpful.,5
2679,"I thought the Week 4 was a bit rushed and some content could be divided into two or more videos. The Labs were really stressful (yet valuable) and the pacing changed dramatically comparing to the three first weeks. Other than that, everything was great and I learned a lot. Cheers Mr. Porter!",4
2680,Cool,5
2681,"Easy to follow, good beginners' Android course without wasting time explaining how to add 2+2.",5
2682,Very high quality content and very challenging exercises.,5
2683,"Great course, but it requires personal work to keep the pace, especially for person who are not familiar with Java development. But while challenging it is d",5
2684,Excellent content as an introduction to Android programming. The videos are paced nicely. Assignments are designed well.,5
2685,"Thank you very much , good course , i have learnt alot of things about Android programming .",4
2686,"Very informative, concise course. Without prior experience in adroid I have learned a lot about android itself and android programming.",5
2687,Good course that goes over the material,5
2688,Very good course of basics of Android Development! Thanks a lot!,5
2689,good introcreating interest to learn,5
2690,Very good and interesting course for beginning programming Mobile Applications.,5
2691,Great course! Good refresher on Java.,5
2692,"Thank you for the course, simply and effectively!",5
2693,"This course was great for me. I was looking for a refresher course since I had some Android experience, but due to different career path I have not used in about 4 years. It was good for me.",4
2694,Very good course! Easy to understand and practice for new bie who beginer with Android development,5
2695,it is very well.,5
2696,Very good and easy to understand course for Android beginners.,5
2697,"Makes you find a solution by thinking, not just copying course materials.",5
2698,must for everyone who ever wants to learn android in great depth,5
2699,Very good course. Very helpful.,5
2700,Moves too fast though,4
2701,Very useful introduction of android fundamentals!!!,5
2702,That´s great!,5
2703,"Learnt a lot! Very challenging and hands-on course for students with passion :)Taught with lots of examples, and equips you with a lot of resources for future use.",5
2704,I really enjoyed this course and found it very enjoyable. The content itself is a bit old but still perfectly relevant. Looking forward to Part 2.,5
2705,"Great course, extremely useful material and on point.",5
2706,A basic course but not for the ones who don't know anything about java or android. Not made for the beginners. Also the submitting projects work is complicated and should be made more easier.Not recommended for the starter.,2
2707,"In depth, but very well explained, leaving very little uncertainty. Great course, explaining the basics needed to build a solid app with (some) previous java experience!",5
2708,I like this programme its very helpful and encouraging for me to do programming,3
2709,Easy to understand and the course is very well made.,5
2710,Very nice content and very well explained. Examples are good too.,5
2711,A great course to take because the useful and simple explanations made by prof. Porter. The course gives us the first steps to be android developers in a fun an simple way. Excellent Course.,5
2712,Nice chose to start an Android developing life.The class is very logical and interesting. All the home works are easy to finish .I am in the part 2 of this class now.,4
2713,Very good Course,5
2714,Very good course.,5
2715,Outstanding course!,5
2716,"I give 4 stars instead 5 just because the last assignments, building an app from scratch, should me more interesting and useful",4
2717,Well structuring matherial.,5
2718,"I found this course to be very helpful. As someone who has used graphical frameworks in the past, I found the course's pace to be just right. Ideas were explained thoroughly, from the ground up, without getting bogged down.",5
2719,"You can really learn a lot from this course. Do give some effort on the labs, and try to understand the way the instructors want you to complete the tasks. It may be a better way to do it.Then, go on to part 2!",5
2720,I found this course lacking in providing sufficient coverage of the basics in the course videos and lacking a useful and directed reading list. I spent far too much time researching command syntax and using try and error to find what worked with the provided code.Disappointing as topics covered are good.,2
2721,Very Nice Course,5
2722,very good content.,5
2723,"Very fast pace with no support. Be prepared to make countless online searches or to discuss solely with peers. Many drop out by the end of the course. Final Project is far too difficult for this course, because it did not prepare me at all. If you want to learn Android programming, I suggest you look elsewhere.",1
2724,A concise and informative introduction to Android. Had fun learning this course. :),5
2725,"Great Course..! but include 10000 of practice test like 3 hour of practice tests because test will prepare you and define what is your level , include job focus to get job , include hackathons .Include direct apply to companies from this course.",4
2726,"I was very excited during Week 1 and Week 2 lectures. Then, the videos kept getting unclear and outdated. The assignment is not engaging. My interest dropped. The videos really need updates!",3
2727,Very Good Course.,5
2728,Probably the best and most useful Coursera MOOC on Android,5
2729,Overall I think the course was good. This course requires you to do a lot of self study and research on every single topic. It only covers the very basic and core topics. I would have liked it to have more hands on or practical examples.,3
2730,Excellent but a little bit intense and high-required course! Like it!,5
2731,Awesome course..should take!,5
2732,"Very good material, very good professor!",5
2733,"I was disappointed in the lack of explanation for the tools. Since everything depends on the IDE, and there was no instruction about the IDE, I found it difficult to do the labs. In the course of trying to, the IDE somehow managed to corrupt my hard drive. After that I pretty much lost interest in the course.",1
2734,A nice course for everyone who wants to start programming Android.,5
2735,I joined this course and after two weeks I fell behind because of my final college exam and again I re join this course. This course is superb course. After join this you will no need to go any institution for android course. Thanks University of Maryland and Professor.,5
2736,"One of the most valuable an interesting courses I have ever joined.The contents are precise and accurate.It forces students to practice what they learned in an effective way.It's very clear from the beginning to whom this course if for. In other words, it does not claim that it target all users just to gain popularity.Objectives are very clear and honest.In conclusion, for those who meet the course requirements and search for what this course is teaching, this course is AWESOME.",5
2737,very nicely explian,5
2738,What a wonderful course. It gives each of us a way to help in the best possible manner. One would think that only serious philanthropists can help when in fact every single person can.,5
2739,The course is very good.,5
2740,"Thought provoking and persuasive, this course is both an excellent introduction to the study of ethics and to the growing movement striving for a better world - effective altruism.",5
2741,"Fairly well presented in that different points of view on the questions were put forward. I found it interesting and informative to learn how better to choose compare and charities.Unfortunately there seems to be a dominate premise. That is this course insists one must give up the maximum part of ones income to 'charities' who will do the job to help others for you. In this I disagree and have not changed fundamentally in my perception.Having said that, one does come away with more motivation to think about and to act more altruistically as the occasions present themselves.",4
2742,Well balanced approach that invites multiple perspectives on ultruism. I would have liked to see the objections against ultruism of Ayn Rand being addressed in the course but I suppose it is difficult to give a course that addresses all aspects of a given topic. But Ayn Rand had a definite contradictory viewpoint and it would have enhanced the class tremendously if it had been considered.,4
2743,"Solid course, makes the case both for acting ethically, and for rationally choosing how to carry out those ethical activities. I had heard most of these arguments before and was already convinced by them; but if you are looking to figure out how to do more good with your life, it is a good course.",4
2744,"very complex, super challenging and helpful",5
2745,"While this course is interesting and informative, I was hoping that there would be a larger portion dedicated to jobs, industries, and ideas that help make the world a better place. I was hoping that by the end of this course, I would have learned about many more options on how to act now, today, as opposed to such a strong emphasis on the origin and meaning of ethics.",3
2746,"Audited the course. Found the information quite useful. In the quest to live an evermore ethical life, Peter Singer helps to bring light to the issues at hand in an accessible way.",4
2747,Professor Singer does a wonderful job of bringing in lauded philanthropists to help make this course a reality. My only qualm was with my expectation of a greater philosophical aspect to the course: he does spend some time on Kant and Hume's ethical dichotomy which was wonderful though.,5
2748,"A nice introduction, but having already been acquainted with the material somewhat, it came of as a bit stale. Some of the bits on moral theories at the beginning were new and informative, and the interviews were interesting regardless.",5
2749,A super detailed and informative course on EA!,5
2750,"Very interesting course, very interesting discussions. There's a lot to think about what is the best way to help others. Singer is very clear and I share most of his ideas.",5
2751,Having an essay as a final assignment was great!,5
2752,I love the theory in this course.,5
2753,I love it!,5
2754,"Thought provoking, were well orchestrated, I am learning, and I am moved, and I think we are all moved towards making the world a better place.",5
2755,Life changing,5
2756,"This course is amazing, more than I expected, you can relate it with everything, no matter your career, it´s effective",5
2757,"Very strong concept, to take and employ in your day to day life. I found it very vital for not for profit work.However, substantial philosophy knowledge is needed in order to really absorb and follow the argument.",4
2758,Yet another good course that is ruined by a peer review requirement. Dr. Singer is a fascinating person to learn from and I am glad I took the time to pursue the course.,2
2759,For me it was a fantastic course. This is exactly that time in my life when I'm alwasy thinking about what I should work and how can I help as much as I can. This course helped me a lot and I recived a lot of good ideas for my essay and for my life also.,5
2760,"Great material, even better teacher!",5
2761,great array of speakers augmenting the course materiel,5
2762,Thank you for this inspiring course that gives a great introduction into ethics and altruism !!!,5
2763,A very interesting course to understand the relationship between ethics and the current problems.,5
2764,Very well done. I would have liked it if there were more assignments.,4
2765,No passion is on his lecture. There is only dryness and ethical superior pride through his theory.. Altruism without love is an empty vanity and well-designed commercial intention for selling his theory.,1
2766,"I could listen to Professor Singer all day. He draws you in, gets you involved and leaves you wanting more. One can actually see the high regard that his guest speakers have for him and his guests are always interesting and sometimes even fascinating.",5
2767,"The course was well done and included interesting guest speakers. However, I was not keen on the format and am not likely to sign up again for a course where the Coursera student is like a voyeur into the professor's actual classroom. In this case, we were privy to his lectures at Princeton and the camera frequently panned the classroom full of students. I have taken many Coursera classes and all were directed at the Coursera student specifically. I appreciated that. And I also appreciated Peter Singer allowing us into his Princeton classroom. I realize what an incredible opportunity he gave us through Coursera. So, thanks.",4
2768,"It's been a great experience to now deep this amazing Peter Singer's proposal. I appreciate a lot the way that ethical ideas, feelings and projects are exposed and shared with all of us. The result is not only to get more knowledge about effective altruism but to have the chance of changing our lives.",5
2769,"Excellent course, very useful. However, the examples of people to be admired for giving their kidneys to strangers, etc.were quite beyond the realm of the everyday life of most individuals with family responsibilities, etc. The course did reinforce my own attitudes toward most ""charities,"" which are not effective nor altruistic. The lectures were just that, lectures, rather bland because we are used to animations and charts to illustrate lessons.",5
2770,"Excellent course, highly recommended if you are interested in supporting or giving to charities, getting to know how you can effectively donate and where your money is being invested properly and it's effectiveness. Gives great insight on what types of advocative work is being done, evaluation methods, criteria and what people should support. Very clear information on how to lead a better life and a more meaningful, helpful, altruistic life.",5
2771,"This is a fabulous course. I think anyone interested in giving and philanthropy should take this course, to better understand the concept of effectiveness. I took this course to identify my own role for giving, and the content and interviews helped me to shape my vision within my modest income. Hurrah for Peter Singer and Princeton offering this course to the world!",5
2772,"Best speech of balanced summary, which is very important to me, for one.",5
2773,"Too many lectures, specialized audience with huge competition, not accessible by novices of philosophy and only assessed through a single peer-reviewed assignment-essay.",1
2774,as the name suggests this is really an effective altruism,5
2775,Excellent lectures. In Colombia should be issued this style of lectures to sensitize the professionals of tomorrow.,5
2776,Really influential course.,5
2777,"It would have been nice to use more complex data analysis, as used in the second course of this specialization, in order to build the final model.",4
2778,Great capstone course that successfully integrates all the concepts learning in the previous courses.,5
2779,Wonderful course! The final project is so interesting! I could also communicate with my peers and learn from their work.,5
2780,poor design on presentation assignment,1
2781,"Absolutely fantastic course and specialization. It was hard work with some very late nights but the best things don't come easily. I wish to thank Dr Egger and Dr Schaich Borg for their energy, enthusiasm and time to make this course so good - and to making it accessible at such a reasonable cost to us in Africa. The dancing videos were a scream and I finally ""get"" the unicorn thing. One of the most profound learning experiences I've ever had.",5
2782,"Simply awesome, it did not only helped me to develop the required skills, but gave me the security to try greater. Astounding method, totally recommended specialization",5
2783,It's very worth taking.,5
2784,"The capstone project and corresponding course work is amazing. The project is framed as a business analysis problem with you acting as the analyst. You are tasked with exploring the company's database to extract the relevant information, construct a predictive model in Excel, visualize the results in Tableau, and deliver a persuasive presentation for your expert recommendation. This project actually utilizes skills learned throughout the specialization with an actual application of knowledge. Duke doesn't leave you stranded though. The course offers quizzes along the way to ensure that you have the correct values to arrive at the correct assumptions at each step so you know you can accomplish this task. I highly recommend this project and thank the University for this learning opportunity.",5
2785,"Fantastic course, very well prepared. Thank you !!!",5
2786,"Previous courses in this series was better. This iteration is very ""paint-by-numbers"", much of the material, conclusions, format, is already prepared in advance.",3
2787,This is an excellent course - really stimulating and very practical as well. Jeremy Ghez teaching is highly engaging and thought provoking. Well worth the time and effort!,4
2788,"All in all this was a very good course. Jeremy Ghez is a bright and inspiring teacher. The content of the course was extremely interesting and well put together. I would have certainly enjoyed to have some sections of the course expanded, which was my only disappointment. I thought the assignments were very well handled and def",4
2789,"Great course about anticipation, resilience and how we can re-invent ourself to be more optimistic about life",5
2790,COMPREHENSIVE AND EXCELLENT,4
2791,Good course with basic concepts.,4
2792,Very insightful,5
2793,Exceptional and practically resourceful. The lecture delivery was clear and broken down in an understandable format.,5
2794,Superb course delivered by an excellent instructor.,5
2795,Great content. I would bundle the shorter videos in the first two weeks so that I am not listening to an intro and outro for every small point that the professor makes.,5
2796,I enjoyed this class. I recommend for everyone.,5
2797,"Thanks for this course! It attempts to provide not only knowledge, but also use in practice. It was a really great chance to learn accounting for me.",5
2798,"Mini-project grades system is awful. btw, you have to wait till three students review you project. One more point is that, the contents of videos are not that enough. You can just read the required textbook to get all knowledge and examples.",2
2799,"Clear and concise, with very good explanation !",5
2800,"It is a great course, well designed and gives important skills and knowledge in a practical way to apply in business desicions.",5
2801,Great course,5
2802,Professor Hecht provides a very thorough and understandable class in Managerial Accounting. He mixes application with concepts. I've never liked accounting until I took his courses. He's a phenomenal teacher.,5
2803,"A very informative and detailed course. The professor explained clearly all the topics and have answered all the questions in my mind through the entire course. The instructions, modules, and handouts were given completely and are very helpful.",5
2804,Very helpful and interesting course.,5
2805,This course is fitted for me who want to self study.,4
2806,A good introduction,4
2807,boring assaignments,2
2808,Not a simple class,3
2809,"This course is great, very explicit and easy to follow.",5
2810,Very detailed course，fantastic,5
2811,Good course. Covers the fundamentals very well.,5
2812,"well structured, logical sequence, great foundation course!",5
2813,I have gained a lot from this class especially since i deal with special children the strategies and goes about me has give me a lot to boost my teaching skills. How to understand the child and control them has solved a lot of my queries and thus helped me.Thanks a lot for this great opportunity to learn more,5
2814,"It is very informative. It suggests some very good strategies for parents, teachers, para-educators and psychologist.",5
2815,It's been great!,5
2816,Very informative especially with tips on how to implement things in the house with children.,5
2817,"Gosh, I learned a wealth of solid information. Very thought-provoking course but one that eased my anxieties all at that same time. Great experience taking this class. One that undoubtedly enables you as a learner to implement what you've learned in the real world.",5
2818,"I enjoyed the simplicity but at the same time depthness of the course, it gave me usefull and easy to apply tools in my practice.",5
2819,This course was really enjoyable and useful. I have put in place a number of techniques and have been able to share with other member of staff many of the strategies recommended in the course.,5
2820,Amazing course!,5
2821,Thank you! I now feel more confident to approach ADHD in the classroom. The resources shared will be invaluable as I continue to learn and to respond to the needs of the individual students in front of me. Thank you for your efforts in putting this course together! I really enjoyed it.,5
2822,I loved how insightful this course is and it does not once mention medications!!!,5
2823,A must for every teacher !,5
2824,Wonderful resource for parents and teachers and families!,5
2825,"Very easy course and the set up was very predictable, although I do wish that the course switched up some things so that it wasn't the same every week. Nice overview of ADHD. I liked how the power points were included so that I could go back and look at them and all of the extra reading materials are very helpful.",4
2826,"It was very beneficial, thanks for the opportunity.",5
2827,The course provides a concise overview of the disorder and suggests some strategies to cope with it at home and in school. I found it a bit too short and too simple.,3
2828,Very Helpful!,5
2829,Quite informative.,4
2830,Nicely organized to learn the practical implications and the intervention techniques,4
2831,I have certainly learned more about myself....,5
2832,"An useful course that will help caregivers understand how to deal with children having ADHD, to strategize for betterment, and to monitor progress and outcomes.",5
2833,The course is very helpful. It has cleared many misconceptions I had. I am sure the Daily Report Card and Behaviour contract will prove to be very helpful. I just wish some more classroom behaviour management strategies could be shared.Thanks!,4
2834,Thank you,4
2835,"An easy to understand, straight-forward insight into dealing with children with ADHD. Would recommend.",5
2836,Great strategies for parents and teachers!,5
2837,Great tips for parents and teachers. Useful tools for classrooms and resources to work in home with a child with ADHD. I strongly recommend this course if you're a teacher or a parent with a child with ADHD.,5
2838,Very helpful and useful strategies for working with elementary age students.,5
2839,"It's not professional as that one created by Penn Uni. Named ""Pay attention "" which is unavailable now and I don't understand why has it been removed from Coursera?!!",3
2840,Very informative course.,5
2841,A very useful course full of everyday strategies for parents and teachers.,4
2842,Interesting course and quite useful additional sources are provided in this course.,4
2843,The course content was very relevant and to the point. Especially the focus on interventions and strategies are easy to implement.,5
2844,Excellent structure and presentations! Highly recommend!,5
2845,Very poor in all aspects.,1
2846,This is very informative and helpful to me.,5
2847,Especially the fourth week was very informative and positive.,4
2848,Dr. Fabiano's expert knowledge delivered in simple easy language makes this course easy for anyone to understand.,5
2849,Informative and useful with practical examples to apply right away.,4
2850,Very informative with good tools. Appropriate for parents as well as professionals working with children and families.,5
2851,Great,5
2852,I learned so much about ADHD and I love the practical component of the course e.g. strategies that can be used. Thank you,5
2853,"Shame on you University of Houston SystemI did the first three lessons, which are less than average, then went on to quiz 1, after completion, a window appeared to ask me for money to get my results! This information should have been provided when I enrolled! I find that very mis leading.",1
2854,Some content on quizzes wasn't covered in the videos,3
2855,Great review for the AP Physics 1 exam!,5
2856,Too much question and it takes me too much time on it,4
2857,"The lectures are rather simple and easy to follow, but it's impossible to pass the quizzes with only a basic knowledge of mathematics/physics, only for experts. With the information provided in the video lectures you won't recieve a grade, there's a lot of extra work necessary with no other help given then some wiki that only a math genius would understand without any further help.",1
2858,A very good course to start with while analyzing the astrophysical data with opensource software..... a must learn by all astrophysics student.,5
2859,very good start for iOS developers,4
2860,Such a great course. I absolutely am amazed by how good it is.,5
2861,Great!!!,5
2862,It`s great.,5
2863,Very visual lessons explaining step by step how to code in SWIFT. If those that do not speak portuguese can easily follow this course. I would recommend that captions in English are added to this course or the instructor presents it in English.,5
2864,"It`s great, simple and very efficiently. I`m not a professional programmer and I`m learning everything.",5
2865,"ME PARECIO UN MUY BUEN CURSO EL CUAL CUENTA CON EJEMPLOS PRACTICOS MUY REALES LOS CUALES AYUDAN A UN MEJOR ENTENDIMIENTO DE LA TEORIA. EN EL CASO DE LOS ENTREGABLES ME PARECEN LOS ADECUADOS YA QUE TIENEN UN BUEN GRADO DE COMPLEJIDAD EL CUAL AYUDA A ESFORZARSE Y APRENDER DE FORMA NATURAL LO APRENDIDO EN CADA UNO DE LOS MODULOS VISTOS, ASI COMO AL EVALUAR A COMPAÑEROS EN EFECTO ME AYUDO A PODER CONOCER MIS AREAS DE OPORTUNIDAD PARA LOS SIGUIENTES ENTREGABLES EN BASE A LOS TRABAJOS DE OTROS COMPAÑEROS.",5
2866,"I do recommend the course, for both the methodoly and content, the tips it gives, the mindset it developsgo on Ronald !",4
2867,"Really superb! Great PLAs, fantastic stories, very tangible but also steeped in theory and research.",5
2868,"This course provides a road map that creates new possibilities that is relevant on the individual level and on the organization level. This road map guides the discovery of our dreams, hopes and strengths. It guides us towards creating a shared purpose and vision. It guides us towards creating an aspiration statement and take action to fulfill the statement.",5
2869,Wonderful practical course!,5
2870,"Great methodology, provides all you require to be able to apply it in real life.",5
2871,The professor is outstanding and the subject really interestingAll the chapters were veruy well explanied,5
2872,I am working as an organisational consultant and thought this would add some knowledge - however it is really difficult to follow because it seems repetitive to me... I have paid for the certificate and still it is difficult for me to focus. It seems there is too much information and too much talk for things that are easily understood and do not need all this going over and over again. I got bored by the time I got to week 3 and it is seems impossible to stay focused and complete all assignments. I hope this changes in my third and last chance to get the certificate...,3
2873,I rated this as a 3 though I got a lot more out of the concepts and the class in the way it was taught than I had when reading books and literature on the subject. I would have wanted more discussions with cohorts taking the class to help cement the practices by virtue of seeing it from other perspectives in different work environments. I can imagine the same class with a moderator and someone facilitating the discussions would get me to the 5 rating. In a nutshell the content is great the experience of the class could be at a higher level then what I experienced.,3
2874,"This course is straightforward, and at the same time deep going. the reading and available books on the topic, enable considerable in depth study. I find the work load very reasonable, still I have the impression I have learnt a lot.",5
2875,Great material. The inclusion of case studies definitely helps.,5
2876,Great Course!!,5
2877,Despite the material being interesting the instructor's way of teaching it made it boring and hard to pay attention,3
2878,"Very interesting course because I learnt several specific pieces of knowledge about adjectives that I didn't know. Besides, I discovered appositives",5
2879,it is fun and usefull,5
2880,one of the best English courses,5
2881,"Very good course, thank you !",5
2882,Adjectives and Adjective clauses was a topic interesting in which I learn enough grammar,5
2883,I miss more homework.,4
2884,this is really useful,5
2885,Very useful. It makes me easily to understand.,5
2886,I think tests should be little more difficult,4
2887,Great course for those just learning and those who want a refresher.,5
2888,I congratulate the group of instructors who did a good job. I learned many new things a didn't know about adjectives. It was an excellent course.Best regards.Anibal Hernandez,5
2889,Great course!,5
2890,it is good thing to learn,2
2891,Adjectives and Adjective Clauses are such a pain! It blows my mind off! :-) Thank for that course. It is very helpful!,5
2892,Great course. You learn a lot!!,5
2893,improve and simplify the grammar structure explanation,4
2894,excellent grammar course!!! i have ever done.it's so easy to understand.,5
2895,Thanks everyone for such an interesting experience.,4
2896,Well structured courseCourse material download as a summary would be great (PPT/PDF),3
2897,I enjoyed this course well as the usage of adjectives is very confusing for me. Its worth learning. Thanks for teachers they made things easy.,5
2898,very helpful,5
2899,well managed course...,5
2900,Amazing course,5
2901,Thank you so much . this course is very useful,5
2902,Thank you! One of the most clever course I have learned. Teachers are awesome!,5
2903,I learned a lot. I recommend it to everyone,5
2904,It's great to have access to the course even when you're not paying the certificate. Tip: make the presentations more attractive.,4
2905,"This is a very interesting course. It helps me a lot. Thanks, anyway.",5
2906,Extremely useful course! One of the simpliest and engaging explanations of such a difficult topic I have ever seen!,5
2907,Very good. Calculus is something everyone should try. This course really explains what it is really about and how to use it.,5
2908,Great course! The course overcome my expectations! Thanks Jim Fowler for share your knoledge.,5
2909,"Good, but Not as accessible as Calculus One as for some abstract concepts, for math amateurs like me. I am still confused where I can put what I learned in this course into practice. But I want to learn more about sequences and series using other resources.",4
2910,Loved this class!,5
2911,"Sir, your style of explaining is awesome. If someone needs to learn how to teach, he/she should watch your way of explaining things. Your enthusiasm for teaching is just way out of any other teacher's limit! Respect for you sir.",5
2912,Wonderful course! Professor Fowler is very engaging.,5
2913,"Many of the problem sets ask you to apply theorems in ways that have not been demonstrated. If a student makes a mistake, no feedback is given other than, ""That is not the right answer"".",2
2914,"Horrible, endless rambling, no solutions to the quiz questions (unlike cal 1 course). sucks all the fun out of math, avoid this course, find an alternative where you can learn more with less time spent watching him write out 20 numbers.",1
2915,Great course,5
2916,Really really thanks Mr. Fowler.,5
2917,Thank you so much Prof. Jim and OSU team for this awesome enrichment course that just proved to be a blessing. I loved the very way Prof. Jim taught me. He is so good. I look forward to meeting him again. When I was giving the final exam I felt the glimpses of what Prof. Jim used to write and say in the video.I also thank Coursera for the opportunity.,5
2918,"Superb course by Jim Fowler. You can easily tell he's very passionate and knowledgeable about Mathematics. He keeps it fun but challenging, brilliant!",5
2919,The lessons and explanations were very interesting and easy to understand.,5
2920,Best for clarity. Interesting content too.,5
2921,"This course helped to clarify so many sequences and series concepts. It even added new analytical tools to my repertoire. While I would not claim to be a Calc II master, I feel that I now have a much better understanding and can move forward confidently.",5
2922,Excellent course. Thoroughly enjoyed it,5
2923,Excelent teacher and course!,5
2924,Not an easy topic but presented well with more than one perspective. Slightly more difficult than One.,5
2925,Quite interactive,5
2926,"For me this course managed to finally get me over the hurdles in really understanding what is going on in sequences and series. The course is fairly difficult, but then so is the subject matter; and the difficulties were not insurmountable. I would give it 5 stars except for a few spots where a little more explanation would have been helpful e.g., the relationship between the indices in the two forms of the Taylor series for the cosine function.",4
2927,"Great course! The material is presented in a logical order and in an easy-to-understand way. In the videos, proofs for most of the concepts and methods are discussed, so ""why?"" is no longer a mystery. The textbook also is a good supplement to the videos. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about sequences and series.",4
2928,"The best part about this course is the way Prof. explains the intuition behind most of the proofs. For example, it seems(to me) more intuitive that harmonic series shall converge but the way Prof. developed intuition that harmonic series diverges, was awesome. This central theme in both the calculus courses from Prof Jim Fowler helped a lot.",4
2929,"Great course :-). Very helpful with the challenging chapter, for most students, of sequences and series in a typical 2nd semester calculus course. It goes even beyond the typical curriculum by emphasizing why sequences and series are relevant.",5
2930,"A marvelous teacher, I am so fond of his style! He makes calculus a real fun.",5
2931,A wonderful course. Prof Fowler is outstanding and the material covered was excellent.,5
2932,"I've learnt a lot of calculus skill in this course. Thanks mr Jim, you're great teacher!",5
2933,The overall course was excellently managed. The lectures were really superb. Prof. Jim was explaining every concept with fantastic details. His way of teaching is exemplary. The most important thing was quizzes. Quizzes contained questions which were not so easy and at the same time not so difficult. I enjoyed the course . More and more such courses will be welcome by students and teachers of Mathematics.,5
2934,His enthusiasm is really contagious and the explanations are very clear and easy to understand. It would be nice to have a sequence on differential equations.,5
2935,Great course!,5
2936,I liked it a lot,5
2937,"The professor is extremely passionate and well-informed about the subject. However it would have been a lot better if he used a more visual approach to explaining things (including graphs and diagrams).The positives about the course are:- There’s plenty of proofs for those who are so inclined. So you really get to understand what’s leading up to a particular formula.- The professor shows some very interesting applications such as showing why 22/7 and pi are not the same and constructing a bridge with only one side (harmonic tower) which is a real eye opener.- He shows you that the concepts in calculus are all deeply connected. There is not a single piece of the puzzle that does not fit with the other pieces. Getting this realization is probably one of the key value propositions of this course.- The mentors in the forums are extremely helpful and respond quickly to your queries.- You learn a lot about using formal mathematical symbols.- The questions are incredibly hard and very little in way of practice examples are provided. This forces you to up your game and really try to understand how things work. Things that are learned with a lot of hard effort are retained much better than things learned without much effort. Hence, I highly recommend this course and am grateful that I took it!If you are the kind of person who likes everything to be served cut and cleaned on a silver platter, you are not likely to enjoy this course. However, if you enjoy solving puzzles with often missing, incomplete, or poorly presented information then this course is exhilarating!The course can be improved by:1. Adding more concrete example with real numbers to show how some of the theorems work.2. Adding more graphs to show how the functions look.3. Adding more practice problems with clear explanations in case you get it wrong.4. Ensuring that exercises are in sync with the sections being presented (for example, in the middle of the course we’re asked a question which involves the Taylor series which is not presented till the last week.)5. Adding more worked out examples with detailed explanations6. Avoiding using confusing variable names (like “little m” and “big m”)I learned a lot in this course.The best lesson was when professor Jim Fowler says that the point of mathematics is not truth but proof. Not whether something is true but why.",4
2938,"I enjoyed this course and recommend it. Prof. Fowler is very didatic and funny, and makes the classes nice to watch.I found some of the exercises a little harder than the content given, and the support is not that perfection yet, but one can find some good help in the foruns if ask in advance (in my case, I must thank a lot my peers Brian and Richard...they were true mentors).Anyway, if you have some interest in series, I am sure you will enjoy this course.",5
2939,Most enjoyable calculus MOOC that I have seen. Dr. Fowler is great.,5
2940,good course,4
2941,An excellent course.Professor Fowler is very enthusiastic and he is a great teacher.,5
2942,the best thing is that you explain why it is like this not just giving facts,5
2943,This course is amazing!,5
2944,"Great course, super and awesome instructor, kuddos!!!",5
2945,"This course is awesome. Jim Fowler is very good teacher. His explanations are concise, but very easy to assimilate because of all the visual resources. I loved the fact that the videos were short overall, since I do not have much free time to keep watching slow long videos.A perfect score.",5
2946,Fantastic course,5
2947,very learner friendlyI like his numerical approach to demonstrate concept or a formula.,5
2948,The course is really helpful but I think it would have been much better if there were answers to all the practice quizzes since some of them are really challenging.,4
2949,"I had already studied series in undergraduate course, came here to just revise and didn't expect the course to be this much AWESOME.Hands down to this one. Just take it if you hate series, this guy would make you fall in love with it!",5
2950,"The best course about mathematics that I've ever taken. The course is very interesant, the videos are very well done, the activities and quizzes are very challenging. I had seen sequences and series a time ago and I didn't like them at all, but now it is a complete different story. I really enjoyed this course and I recommend it.",5
2951,"It's very useful and dinamic, great experience.",5
2952,"This is an excellent course and the course tutor's lectures are clear, thorough and amusing. This is the future of learning Math and Sciences. Some brief summary notes of the key points would have been useful, to save one having to trace back through the videos to find something.",5
2953,showing relation to physics,5
2954,"This course will supplement your class, but do not use it as a single source.",4
2955,"I appreciate the free course, but it seems that this course is not comprehensively prepared like the first course. 1) There are no solution, and sometimes nothing at all, provided under the wrong answer of each task in practice quizs. And 2), the tasks are not 100% related with previous radios, which could be frastrating for people like me who want to solve all tasks before entering into the next session. 3) Some important points are missing in the video whereas less significant points are overdressed in excessive details.",4
2956,Great approuch on series e sequences...,5
2957,It is a fantastic course. Learnt a few concepts which were not covered in my calculus classes at school and took the opportunity to learn!,5
2958,the best teacher,5
2959,"excellent, very good teacher",5
2960,"I use this and Calculus One as reference when I need to remind myself some more basic concepts. It's so easy to find the relevant video lecture and have it explained in different ways, great refresher.I love Jim Fowler's style, he makes me laugh :)",5
2961,"Consistent video format, good explanations, video length not too long but also not too short.",4
2962,"I give four stars rather than five because I felt that the course seemed less well executed than Calculus One by the same author. He set a high bar for himself. Still, I learned a lot and do appreciate it. I felt the practice quizzes could have been more helpful in the explanation of wrong answers as was the case in Calculus One.",4
2963,Very slow beginning and quite few gaps between videos and quiz but very nice to go back to basics and practice calculus again,4
2964,"There are a few mistakes that you need to look out for (check the discussion forum), but overall, this is a very good course!",4
2965,A very well designed course with great explanations.,5
2966,"Outstanding course, Prof. Fowler has immense energy, a great teacher....",5
2967,wonderful and helpful!!!,5
2968,Thank you so much.,5
2969,Its tough to get your head around the various concepts but as Dr. Fowler and the reading material say - Don't be afraid and use lots of paper. I'm 41and a non-engineering graduate. I completed this course so that I may take additional science and engineering related courses on-line.,5
2970,very good course,5
2971,"It had been a while, and I really enjoyed rediscovering the series through this course, whether by watching the videos -providing intuitions, main points, key notions, and concrete examples (every-day-life ones and mathematical ones, as a particularly appreciated example, see the bridge video) given by an enthusiastic mathematician- or by following his related mooculus book -providing formal course materials (but you can still picture the professor explaining things to you, which is really enjoyable) including all the definitions, theorems, and justifications, and a lot of exercises with their answers, completing gracefully the videos.I truly hope that, in future coming courses, I will have the opportunity to have this professor dealing with other subjects -like integrals (on non-bounded domains) or function series- that can be related and used, afterwards, with series through dedicated theorems.",5
2972,In my case I listened to all courses as a refresher of things that I learned in college about 25 years ago. It felt great to solve problems that I have not had a chance to do for a long time. I relived my college days in the process I gained a new insight that I can use in my current job as a EE.,5
2973,"very helpful, thank you for this material",5
2974,"same review as for Calculus I, awesome course, i haven't followed all the lectures, as i am only refreshing stuff, but is awesome!!!",5
2975,Great course for learning the basics of calc! Thanks Prof Jim Fowler! :D,5
2976,The course is fun to learn,5
2977,"Thank you, Jim! Very well prepared course. Well chosen examples and problems, but that's just my opinion. Nevertheless, problems and quizzes really helped me understand the materials better in this course and in Calculus 1 (MOOCulus).Oh, and it follows a free (open) textbook! What!?",5
2978,This was the best course on sequences and series I have ever seen.,5
2979,"Excellent teacher, great course!",5
2980,Great course!,5
2981,"Overall ,a very good course!!",5
2982,"The teacher is greatly great...energetic,hardworking,and the best thing about him is he knows students needs while learning things.",5
2983,"This course tackles two difficult topics- sequences and series. The instructor does well to build insight and conceptual understanding instead of just teaching how to solve problems using the formulas just as in his previous course. However, I believe that this course is more difficult than the previous one and learners may be stuck at some points in the course if not armed with the right tools and techniques. Also it takes some amount of rereviewing before you can understand some of the concepts.",5
2984,"Jim Fowler is fantastic. It's hard to make sequences and series exciting and engaging, but he manages to do it. As with conventional classroom courses, certain techniques work better than others for online learning. His pedagogical techniques for breaking down derivations and equations work incredibly well for online learning videos. I would eagerly take another class taught by Professor Fowler again. May I suggest classes in Differential Equations and Partial Differential Equations? I didn't take those in college, and over 20 years later, I still regret it and feel the lack of knowledge in my working life.",5
2985,Thank you. The lessons were very interesting!,5
2986,Awesome professor and a very informative and helpful course. The professor explains in such a good manner. 10/5 and not 5/5.,5
2987,"Very good, Focussed in learn the philosophy and know some mathematical tricks in the proofs. It was funny!!",4
2988,"The videos are fun and engaging, and the professor explains even the most abstract concepts in ways that are easy to understand.",5
2989,"Although a bit in-your-face, the presentation is excellent. It combines the clarity of highly visible and easily audible, well-prepared material with a friendly informality. I especially like the paper-and-sharpie technique.",5
2990,Great course Great Instructor,5
2991,The lessons are amazingly interesting,5
2992,Worth completing as much for the demonstrated pedagogy as the covered material!,5
2993,"Great explanation, challenging quizzes. May be very difficult for those who aren't used to grasping concept in maths.",4
2994,Excellent course. Very well taylored and fun. Worth the time spent.,5
2995,"I am just in the middle of this course. Mr. Fowler explains basic concepts perfectly. He is so joyful. I can watch the videos while eating ,just like watching the tv series :P . I look forward to study Taylor Series",5
2996,"very clear, very nice. and this is more suitable to me than my own lecture's course.",5
2997,Excellent..teachers are very enthusiastic about teaching which is helpful when learning.,5
2998,"This really is a good extention to the Calculus One course. A bit harder to understand, but I assume this was the main idea of Jim Fowler - to explain, as he mentions in one of the videos, that mathematics is not about calculations - it's about insight. So be prepared for less technical calculations in the tests and more creative thinking on how to solve this or that problem.",4
2999,Jim Fowler is a great math professor!,5
3000,I really enjoy this course. I strongly recommend it.,5
3001,Loved it and I learnt many things from this course.Kudos Prof. Fowler.,5
3002,Many thanks to Dr Fowler for making lessons highly interesting,5
3003,Great course!,5
3004,"great material and presentation, as always. thanks, jim.",5
3005,A great course . I especially liked the teaching style of Professor Fowler.,5
3006,"This is a really helpful course for learning information about Calculus two. However, some areas in explanations were confusing so I had to search more information from the internet and from other professors.",4
3007,"This guy does great lectures, not your average calculus course, keeps it interesting!",5
3008,The journey has been Awesome. A tribute to Dr Fowler.,5
3009,Great course!,5
3010,"I wanted to like this course, but (and perhaps it's a mathematician thing) the teacher just kept doing stuff without explaining WHY he is doing the stuff. He is very animated and a good presenter but, even when I understood what he was saying, I couldn't get past the ""why is he doing this?"" It is never ""self-evident"" for me.",2
3011,I enjoy this course tremendously! It feels like a having a personal teacher explaining the concepts one on one.,5
3012,"I've completed numerous MOOCs but this teacher is simply the best. Very passionate and explains things extremely well. All the lectures look extremely thought out, topics are presented in somewhat funny, but really professional way, quizes are sometimes challenging, but that's great!.If you struggle with Calculus, you should definitely take this course. But it's also great for people that like Math in general - I've passed my Calculus stuff long ago, but wanted to recover that knowledge to enter different programming areas and that was one of the best thing I did last year.Jim, please add more courses!!",5
3013,"Another fantastic course put together by Jim Fowler! The instructional videos provide good arguments and present the theorems, proofs, concepts, etc. very well.",5
3014,Great teacher. The method of explaining things with pieces of paper was helpful and more interactive than lines simply appearing in the screen. Unfortunately the course is based on calculations and many proofs were left behind.,4
3015,One of the greatest and most inspiring Professor of math!,5
3016,This was an awesome course. 10/10 would watch again.,5
3017,"I am taking this same class in college here in Brazil. However, I was having some serious issues about how to interpret all the data. So, I started to take this course, which is helping me a lot to comprehend all the core ideas. Thanks a lot!",5
3018,This teacher is an amazing teacher and made Calculus 1 and 2 both a lot more understandable than professors I've had in person.,5
3019,Jim Fowler is a great professor! Would love to see more content from him! :D,5
3020,"Organized like the ideal textbook, but I would have preferred that there be more practice problems on quizzes.",4
3021,A great job done by a great teacher. Thank you for this successful effort,5
3022,"The course is very helpful in understanding the idea of sequences and series. Starting from zero, you will get a really good understanding of the topic and will see applications of it.I have to admit it. I like the way the prof explains things. He tries to deliver a message that math is not just about numbers and calculations, but insight and understanding.Very helpful and highly recommended if you are interested in math.",5
3023,"Very fun with an amazing teacher ! In that conditions, Mathematics are pure pleasure. Take it and enjoy.",5
3024,Excellent!Read the book with the lectures.Inspirational. Thought provoking. Informative. Challenging.Enjoy :)Jeremy KMS MEd Community College Math Instructor,5
3025,Really enjoy the enthusiasm of the lectures. A couple of lectures run over the material a little quickly.,4
3026,Perfect!,5
3027,"Have never seen any Professor who teaches with such passion as Professor Fowler. This was a tasking course, and I'm glad I have been able to complete it. Lim (n-> inf.) (n * Thanks!).",5
3028,"It was an amazing experience. I like the way it is taught, because it allows to understand useful techniques for approximation without getting rid of the beauty of mathematics. This course has opened my mind to new borders on knowledge. Thank you!",5
3029,"I really appreciate the way Prof. Fowler presents the course. Simple, amusing and interesting the way it is",5
3030,"Solid presentation of the material. Left me wanting more. Professor Fowler's enthusiasm is wonderful, and his presentation makes the material come alive.",5
3031,"It is just perfect! Both, lectures and tasks are really great!",5
3032,Again Jim does a really great job. Care and attention to the presentation of the explanation. Really takes into account he's performing for a camera not a lecture hall. My score is 4/4. I'm not qualified to give the 5th as I can't speak to what has been included and omitted from the content.Bring on multivariate calculus as an on-demand Mooc!,4
3033,"decent course overall, but problem solutions are much missed. even after completing the course perfectly i'm still not sure how I got some answers.for example: ""approximate f^(72)(0) of cos(x^3). I figured the way to solve it, but I hove no idea why it is solved that way.",3
3034,Incredible! Probably the best maths class ever!,5
3035,"The effort put for explanation by Dr. Fowler is extraordinary. However the course needs to show more of the 'connection between steps' when stating a theorem for convergence tests.This current version of calculus is a bit disappointing, earlier the practice problems were solved in steps.",3
3036,Instructor is a champion of pedagogy.,5
3037,it is nice how to learn maths by this way < cause i hate the way of egyptian Drs in my university teach us by reading from books which already i have in my hands and solve the same boring examples >thank you coursea :D,4
3038,An exceptional course as all courses taught by Mr. Fowler,5
3039,I wish I had a math professor with such passion as Jim Fowler ! Congrats this course is amazing !,5
3040,awesome course,5
3041,This course is grate. Just like Calculus 1 it provides intuition and a way of thinking about mathematical concepts.,5
3042,Great course!,5
3043,Great!,5
3044,Best calculus teacher ever.,5
3045,I like too much that it course is all about sequencies and series. A lot of units about its topics is unusual for me. One or two units in other courses. ¡Very nice Calculus two! ¡ Excelent the teacher!,5
3046,"So far very good, very clear explanations.",5
3047,"I am working through this course as a quick revision before graduate school, so the material is quite simple for me. However, I absolutely love the way it is presented. Suddenly, sequences and series don't appear to be as daunting or abstract as it was!",5
3048,"best math course ever, teached with so much passion and love",5
3049,"Simply the best, again.",5
3050,Truly excellent and interesting presentation of the topic by a professor who loves the subject matter. Wonderful.,5
3051,exceptionally explained. I like it,5
3052,....might be considered as a good one,4
3053,Excellent course material. I was thrilled to learn about taylor series and its importance on approximation,5
3054,Really enjoy the energy of the professor. More practice questions would take this to the next level.,4
3055,"Fast and very effective course, though it could be a bit deeper.",5
3056,Even more interesting than the first.,5
3057,The perfect companion for learning calculus!,5
3058,Love it!,5
3059,Amazing course. Really good with you're looking for a solid calculus background!,5
3060,Very helpful information. It always kept me interested!,5
3061,"I love the instructor, she knows her material and she facilitates the information in a manner that is engaging. I am excited to complete this course.",5
3062,Interesting,5
3063,EXCELENTE ES AGIL Y MUY ADAPTABLE A LA SITUACION DE TIEMPOS COMPLICADOS,5
3064,ESTOY FELIZ DE TOMAR MI PRIMER CURSO EN ESTA PLATAFORMA Y QUE SEA UN CURSO DE LA UNAM.GRACIAS,5
3065,It looks like amaizing way to learn,5
3066,"I took this course to practice my Spanish, hoping it would be like the course Learning How to Learn that is in English. If you can watch that course in English instead or along with this one or even just reading the Spanish subtitles, I would suggest that course instead as it is truly amazing. This one is good... as far as it goes. It's hard to follow in the footsteps of Learning How to Learn though because it's one of the best courses in anything I've ever taken. This was a good course to practice my Spanish listening though! There are a few good ideas in here, so worth it.",4
3067,"ES UNA EXCELENTE OPCIÓN PARA APRENDER Y MEMORIZAR MAS Y MEJOR, AMEN DE LEER MAS RÁPIDO Y COMPRENDER TODO LO LEÍDO, YA QUE ESTE CURSO, TE LO DAN POR HASTA $22,000.00, Y PUES ESTA FUERA DE MI ALCANCE ECONÓMICO, LA VERDAD, Y ESPERO AQUÍ PODER HACERME DEL CERTIFICADO, EL CUAL ME PARECE ESTA EN DOLARES, EN FIN, GRACIAS QUERIDA UNAM.",5
3068,"very good I totally recomend it, if you are begginer it is very usefull",5
3069,"This was very difficult course for me (as for newbie). But at the same time it broadened my horizons. AngularJS - very interesting course. I'm glad to become graduate. Special thanks to professor Jogesh K. Muppala for his intelligence, kindness and excellent sense of humour. Also thanks to all people, who made a major contribution to this course: record videos, write subtitles, correct code, consulting as mentors. So I wish prosperity to this course and lots of success!",5
3070,This course is well designed with very good coverage of technical details of various aspects of web development. The exercises and assignments are quite inspiring. I would strongly recommend this course to those want to learn wen development and don't have much experience yet.,5
3071,little bit slow but very good. some extra tools added that make it slow and boring but it makes it very interesting if we understand its benefit,4
3072,Nicely designed course to learn AngularJS,4
3073,"Very good course, materials and hands-on works.",5
3074,"Covers all the essential topics. At the end of the course, one should have enough confidence to try and deploy pages on their own. The topics are well explained and the teacher keeps the listener engaged with his teaching style.",5
3075,Course is very compact and informative,5
3076,"Lots of random details that the professor seems to have missed make the course difficult because you end up spending hours debugging random, irrelevant things.",3
3077,Very well explained from basics,5
3078,"The practical approach of taking a problem and solving it throughout the course and in the process teach stuff is super awesome. You get introduced to a concept and immediately followed by implementing it in the product at hand and thereby improving the product. When you actually do the exercises you get a satisfaction of developing a product along the way, which is very nice.If I ever plan to teach, this is the approach I'll be taking.PS: The sprinkle of humor is refreshing breaks from serious listening otherwise! Thanks for that too.",5
3079,It is a awesome course,5
3080,Great course to be introduced in AngularJS and learn the basic functionality of this framework.,5
3081,"Should be a more in depth course.Although for an introduction into AngularJS, it is a very good course.",4
3082,"Thank you for these lessons, answered my pressing questions about web development",4
3083,I've been trying to learn Angular for so long! This course finally demystified the basics for me.,5
3084,"good and useful course, but includes some content (unit testing) that is extraneous and could be in a separate course",4
3085,Awesome course,4
3086,Its great!,5
3087,Overall course arrangement is awsome,5
3088,"During this course I had many issues with bower and version conflicts. I do everything step by step like in the video, and nothing works. I look at error log and realize there is some issue with versions. =\It would be really nice if you explained how to deal with it, instead of making me waste hours of my time on googling this stuff. It almost made me quit using bower forever.",3
3089,Wonderful course to learn AngularJS. Thank you to Jogesh K Muppala for explaining in a each and every topic and excercises more practically.,5
3090,"Apart from angular i learn task runners, testings, scaffolds and more. Love this one!",5
3091,"This is excellent training for the person who likes to keep up with the latest and greatest front-end developments. If you don't like to switch up and turn on a dime then this course is not for you. I had trouble aplenty and yet the point seemed to be: stay flexible, be prepared to use obscure tools (that are supposed to make the site work better but who knows exactly what is happening under the hood), expect change and adversity, become an expert at debugging that crappy code and refactoring everything at the drop of a hat. This is probably good approximation of real world experience where you would need to come in on a project and bail them out of angularjs damnation. Be prepared to be frustrated.",4
3092,It was a challenging and a fun course. Good in-depth and hands on experience on Angular and other web-tools.,5
3093,"Very nice course! You should include an explanation of the versions of the angular components that are compatible, it could be very releasing.",5
3094,"some difficult, but it's so useful and powerful languages",4
3095,Perfect course to get started with AngularJS,5
3096,Great course to learn about AngularJS. Syllabus is good to provide step by step and deep learning. Examples are good to provide practice practices with steps. Assignment is also a good test for the knowledge learned in each week.,5
3097,Great course.,4
3098,I did not know what was going on and I have to stop.,1
3099,Must for a new age programmer,5
3100,Great!,5
3101,amazing course gave me in-depth knowledge of Angular.js framework!,5
3102,This is a Great Course. However I think that is a wonderful option to have an intermediate leve with angularJs.,4
3103,Should be updated with angular 2 components. Rest it was awesome,4
3104,good and useful course,5
3105,Bad video quality and errors in course material. Worst course on Coursera.,1
3106,Great Course. Thankyou!!,5
3107,"This was my first online course. I have everyday given 2 to 3.30hrs in this course. As angular.js is really in demand, I was eager to learn it and this course is good in terms of the lectures by prof. Muppala , materials and the exercises. Exercises are doable but let me say this to the would be en-rollers that if you miss a tiny winy thing between the scrips, you will have to devote a hell lotta time to fix it . The assignments are challenging and those gave me the feel that angular is not that easy peasy at all. Submitting the assignments on time is suggestible as late submission can create a mess to get required number of reviews on time. I have submitted two assignments after deadline and had to request a lot of classmates to review my submission. Prof Muppala is one great teacher. He is good at explaining stuffs so easily which are actually not that easy. Overall it was a good experience. I am looking forward to what this skill will offer me in my career ahead and also looking forward to learn more from coursera.",4
3108,"The lessons were well structured and easy to follow, while covering all of the essential topics needed to use Angular, including some server-side development tools. As an introductory course, it met my expectations.",5
3109,"I can't even begin to describe how much pain this course gave me.The code snippets and instructions in the exercise videos are incomplete/have errors and it's impossible to complete the exercises just using those (it's hours of extra work to get things working). Also, at some point you are given a new version of part of the files in the project, which won't match the rest of the files so there's remedial work to be done for that too. Some of these issues were flagged on the forum 5 months ago and still the course material wasn't updated. It all gets even worse as all assignments build upon the code written in these exercises.The assignment instructions are unclear. You are shown a demo of how the solution should look in the assignment videos, and then you are told you actually have to build something different than what you were shown. I also couldn't understand some of the grading criteria. You will get/lose marks on uploading a screenshot or naming variables/functions a certain way.I was really interested in this specialization so I kept going hoping it will get better but it only got worse. After 11 weeks of work I am ready to start something different. Wasn't expecting such low quality content on Coursera.",1
3110,Very in depth and practical course that gets you jump-started on AngularJS. The quizzes were a bit too simple but I imagine the assignments would have more content (since they are locked behind purchase). Would love to see a Angular 2 course as well.,4
3111,We need Angular 2,3
3112,Nice Description with good exercises.Please provide a course for Angular 2 also,5
3113,Awesome course for a good startup!!!,5
3114,"Very Good Course to learn. Assignments are very good,",5
3115,"this course overall is great. the content needs to be more in depth and give more compact information in each session. also need to give more detail why we should do certain step instead of just tell how to do.the course offer resources, and this aids with further self-pace learning, which is helpful. the ppt resource could cover more content in detail.overall it is a good course.",4
3116,The most complete course for angular beginners. Grat job teacjer Mupala =D,5
3117,Teacher is awesome and very useful course,5
3118,good. its a worth your time,4
3119,Excellent break down of Angular JS. A very good introduction; you will still need to read the Angular JS docs to get depth.,5
3120,"This course was too messy. I spent 75% of my time to get the examples to work. It would have been better if after each module all the .js and .html files would be given in total, not just the snippets.",2
3121,Great Course. Have a wide knowledge about Angular js.,5
3122,Amazing instructor!,5
3123,Very nice course! Huge amount of things to learn and very useful to work on the web app field! Thanks,5
3124,"Explicit design of course, easy to understand flow and good practice assignments",5
3125,Very Good course. Recommended,5
3126,It was a great course,4
3127,this course is good . thank you for this information .we look forward more,4
3128,"The course was really demanding for me but in the end you feel like you achieved something. Don't give up if your localhosts don't work, there are solutions, look it up.",5
3129,"Good introductory type course but when there are issues a student is having that no other peer can resolve, the instructors are almost NEVER available to assist.",2
3130,Really useful and informative!,5
3131,"Overall pretty good, but I think maybe the course ought to be extended a week or so to really take time and look at descriptions of the tasks run in the task runners. The angular content is pretty good and helpful, though.",3
3132,Great,5
3133,"Should update to Angular 2, or at least revise some exercises to include code for Angular 1.6.. and keep track properly of when gulpfile should be updated!",3
3134,"Starting from fundamental concepts to basic practice, Professor Muppala has the way to make you learn better.",5
3135,Great course. AngularJS is presented gradually with good manners. Super work by Jogesh K. Muppala.,5
3136,A well presented course with broad coverage of AngularJS. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The Coursera platform is excellent and easy to use.,4
3137,Good content and awesome instructor :),5
3138,sir you are best .. i learnt so much from you and i really appreciatie your work for students,5
3139,Good Course Learned much from it,5
3140,"Exercise sources are not up to date, I have come across many problems.",3
3141,Excellent! First time in Angular ; it was a very good course.,5
3142,The course is well structured.,5
3143,Amazing course. Thank you Yakov.,5
3144,One of the best course in coursera. Thanks!,5
3145,Great! I have really learned a lot by attending this course. Hope to see the AngularJS 2 or React course anytime soon :),5
3146,"Amazing Course, made me understand Angular in an easy way. It gave me a good quick start. Hats of to the teacher for all the hard work.",4
3147,it was fun ...,5
3148,Very easy to understand.E,5
3149,Great Course,5
3150,Thanks to Mr. Jogesh for carrying out complex concepts with ease.,4
3151,Awesome course,5
3152,very helpful for newbies,5
3153,"This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like ""take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day"". Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like. You've only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you can't really teach them much in such a short time. So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile. Hey look! Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised. Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc. -- but don't come into this believing that you'll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed. This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding.Want to learn the guitar? This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you. See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra? How about if I simply told you to ""write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12"", and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X. Would you have learned about solving equations? At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt you'd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against. However, this course could be so much more. The model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding, whether in front of a Power Point slide or a text editor full of code, is borrowing from the worst of the ""lecture-first"" classroom experience of (most of) higher ed. It's a bummer that we aren't moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long, but I guess it's still what people expect (or at least have learned to cope with).",2
3154,Rushed though the core material.,5
3155,Definitely Not for young new front end learners .Lots of things difficult to understand.,3
3156,Nice course getting into AngularJS programming foundations and some very useful tools.,5
3157,"Good course, cover most important topics in didatc way. But the code quality is poor and I advice to study the John Papa's Angula code style to learn a better way of using AngularJS.",4
3158,Easy to understand.,5
3159,"This great course will teach you not only how to create a single page application, but it will also show you the basics about developing to the web, as it shows you the tools that will allow you to work better as a web developer.",5
3160,This was a hard course and many of the exercises did not have enough details to complete the assignments on time. I had to rely on course forums and a lot of googling to finish the course successfully.,3
3161,"Many errors appeared doing exercises, material needs to be updated - many node modules already deprecated. Also it'll be better if teacher more clarify all the actions he doing. Sometimes he did something not clear and there was no answer what is happening and why in this way.",3
3162,i got bunch of info in this course i believe i won't get it in organized and net way anywhere else. and i recomned even learn angular from anywhere else take the course.,5
3163,The course was very clear and interesting!,5
3164,Nice course. However I am hearing scratching noises when the tutor is speaking which is little disturbing.,4
3165,This course is not for javascript beginners. You should come in with solid understanding of the language - probably more than you would get from the first two courses of this program.,3
3166,"A bit outdated now, however it is still a good resource to get started.",3
3167,recommended course covers all angular 1,5
3168,Thank you for providing new Angulagr js course,5
3169,This course is very clear. The assignments were very well for improving my understanding.Thank you.,5
3170,Very useful course with excellent course material. However there were some problems with the audio quality. Fixing them would make this course really enjoyable.,4
3171,Not well designed and the professor hard to follow...,2
3172,Very fine explanation,5
3173,This class gives me a very useful knowledge that help me a lot in my work. The teacher's lecture is very suited with novice,5
3174,Nice!! I can write a web application now!,5
3175,Thank you !,5
3176,nice course and nice explanation,4
3177,Excellent source of information.,4
3178,"Angular is very extensive, difficult to understand, but the teacher finds the way putting together everything, Excellent course, the best until now.",5
3179,Excellent course. I was very helpful!!,4
3180,This is the best course in getting the basic understanding of AngularJS. I really did get a lot out this course and I would highly recommend anyone for trying to learn angularJs. The organization and the layout of the course and also the professor explanation of the concept are really great!!,5
3181,Nice Course. Professor makes it more easy and interesting to learn. Thank You Sir.,5
3182,Too hard to listen his English,1
3183,very well structured for learning at our own space!,5
3184,I like the professor...but the activities and projects always had errors and issues that weren't easily fixable. And the mentors are absolutely terrible at providing guidance. So I most likely won't be able to finish this course.,2
3185,"AngularJS is ""The brain"" in the front-end development, and it was the most difficult part of this specialization so far, regarding all the concepts behind, like TDD, REST, MVC, etc. Once that you understand all of these concepts, the course is great. Professor Joggesh explains the angular features in a comprehensive way and his references to external links are a must.",5
3186,very interesting course,5
3187,Super good start for people without any javascript experience. But you will need more in real life :),5
3188,The teacher is amazing,5
3189,"I loved this coursed, it allowed me to get more opportunities in my work field, I highly recommend it.",5
3190,Learning materials are poorly delivered. Codes given are bug-ridden this in turn makes it incredibly difficult to follow on. Disappointing,2
3191,This course is the best part of the Full Stack series. I would like to see a more advance course just on Angular.,5
3192,"I liked this course so much. I never had used Angular JS nor JSON before and now I leanerd something new. Now, I'm going to put in practice all I've learned with my new projects. Thanks a lot to Jogesh K. Muppala and Coursera for the shared knowledges.",5
3193,"Very good course, go ahead",4
3194,"it is good , but some items needs to be illustrated in more details , a great thing of this course is that it gives a lot of practice exercises",3
3195,The tutor is exceptionally good. It included all the sources for documentation but I felt I learned more from by reading the Angularjs official documentation than from this course. Assignments covered a variety of concepts.,4
3196,Great introduction to angular.js,5
3197,For a newbie in Frameworks I could learn a lot! Thanks to the professor and this excelent complete course.,5
3198,Quite a good experience.,4
3199,Very nice explanations!,4
3200,"Very complete course, good teacher on my first experience with coursera, really great !",5
3201,The course was very helpful. I can now work comfortably with Angular. Thank you!,5
3202,"A nice overview on Angular JS, just enough to get you started!",5
3203,There are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help. There are also quirks that aren't mentioned that other students have to point out. Unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation. Feels rushed and it's hard to learn for a beginner. Feels like you're just going through the motions and copy and pasting code.,2
3204,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,3
3205,"Professor just does not explain the concepts well, just reads the code snippets. You need to figure things out the hard way. You don't get too much help from the moderators as well.",4
3206,Amazing course!,5
3207,a great course and good instructor.,4
3208,"Great Course for angular 1.x for angular newbies.It includes almost all the angular basic concept,including module,controller,service,filter,directive,view,data model,expressions,two way binding,dependency injection.And also this course provides a good full example illustrating how to use angular CRUD app.However,finishing this course is far from being proficient in angular developing,you should keep practicing more and find more resources from angular official websites.",5
3209,"very informative and challenging course, i enjoyed finishing it.",4
3210,Challenging but fun!,5
3211,"It's a lot better than trying to learn the methods and information on my own without an instructor. I feel very empowered. In any case, the course was a very good brain workout.",5
3212,Teacher is really bad. Terrible.,4
3213,I definitely enjoyed doing this course. The exercises really helped me understand it and it makes you more involved.,4
3214,Excellent course. Thanks.,5
3215,very useful course,5
3216,There are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his/ her own interest. What a waste of time .,2
3217,Everything is clearly explained! Practice was great!,5
3218,Well i am surprised that Angularjs is not easy to learn but how easily and smartly you teach this course.. Really appreciated Sir!!,4
3219,Loved it,5
3220,A wonderful course! Good theory with coll practices!,5
3221,It help me a lot. thanks,5
3222,very nice and helpful,5
3223,This course is awesome!! it is very informative and you learn a lot as a beginner. I love the blooper alert.,5
3224,"good course, very informative",5
3225,"This course will help you to fall in love with AngularJS. Great explanation and exercise, assignments. Thank you very much.",5
3226,Wonderful course! Love it and learn a lot!,5
3227,clear and the examples are very useful!,4
3228,nice course and sequenced well.,5
3229,"The Course is an extensive coverage of various in-depth resources of technologies and concepts related to AngularJS. I really like the course and the mentor, who is taking great pain in making us understand the jargons behind the course. Thank You Sir for your invaluable insight.",5
3230,easy to learn.,5
3231,"For all the many courses I took on Coursera, this course is one of the best.",5
3232,The course was just fine. Some of the lectures were really good while some lectures were really confusing. The good thing is that course provides excellent resources for further exploring the topics in the course. So i had to consult these additional resources when i find lectures confusing.Course Assignments were really simple. Hardly any assignment took me more than an hour to complete.,3
3233,"It was informative course. Assignments could be more involved, and exercises could be more open-ended.",5
3234,"Examples are clear, very good introductory course. Can using w3schoool as reference",4
3235,This course teach me one important thing : That is my job in the future.,5
3236,Perfect and comprehensive course..thank you very much.,5
3237,I recommend this course for naive to medium level expertise.,4
3238,I like this course for some reasons:- a lot of understandable theory;- good practical tasks;- understandable and detailed speech of teacher.,5
3239,Good quality content and great instructor. I recommend it!It does not cover though a very important feature from angular: directives.,4
3240,Quite helpful,5
3241,Very complex and interesting module.,5
3242,This course is a real workout!,5
3243,Great course!,5
3244,Great!,5
3245,"Overall the course is very good but it gets trickier the further you go, specially if you have no experience in this area whatsoever... Take it from someone who's first contact with Web Development was the first course in this Specialization: ""HTML, CSS & JavaScript"". My advice to students in a similar situation is to look for other sources of information as well and try to experiment with your code as the lessons go by so you can really grasp the meaning of the pieces of code you're writing. Eventually, they'll start to make sense :-)",3
3246,"Extremely poor help and feedback.Almost no replies on discussion forums from mentors/peers so many issues end up unresolved. Considering how difficult this course is compared to other courses, the lack of real assistance is appalling.Seemingly outdated lessons.A lot of errors I get come from version discrepancies. Lessons should be checked over. If I have to Google problems to complete step-by-step lessons, the lesson is extremely ill-prepared.This is enough to make me abort this specialization.",2
3247,Its very challenging for me...,5
3248,This course is awesome!!!!! Thanks,5
3249,"This is wonderful!Thank you, Mr. Muppala.",5
3250,very good course to help me start with angular and javascript frame work learning!,5
3251,"Best full stack courses, even after this single course you can separately make a powerful front end",5
3252,"A great course on Angular JS, explained in an excellent practical manner. Exercise videos clearly show and allow us to practice along which makes the understanding very effective.",5
3253,Good Course,5
3254,Excelent Course!! Very recomended!,5
3255,"Good one.Like the ""Bloomers"" at the end of some videos.",5
3256,A good course for Angular JS.,5
3257,Awesome course!,5
3258,Fantastic. Very glad to have taken this course.,5
3259,Very bad explanation too boring lectures,1
3260,Complete,5
3261,good course,5
3262,sometimes it's hard to get things.. .. but it's very useful and strong course,4
3263,"This course is excellent, highly recommended",5
3264,Had good content but description was a like scattered manner. It could have better if explanation should be in fluent manner.,4
3265,"Very good course, with much to learn. By applying step by step every aspect of the course was for me very helpful. I hope more and more courses to follow this example.",5
3266,Great Course for those who wants to go deeper in Front-End Frameworks,5
3267,This course needs an easier way to peer review. Downloading individual files to computer and plugging into your project without overwriting your own work is a nuisance. Especially during assignment 4 where everything needed to be hosted in the server in order to work; this made is extremely difficult to review.,2
3268,"Great Content, and by the end of the course you have a full fledged Front-end website working.",5
3269,Great course!,5
3270,Wonderful experience (y)Must try!!,5
3271,"Fantastic course, fantastic teacher.",5
3272,"Easy to understand, but hard to listen. I think we need a American teacher",4
3273,Cannot believe charge me homework,2
3274,Great,5
3275,so far excellent. After first week.,5
3276,Everything is explained in a big rush. Very hard to get starting from the second week,3
3277,thank you professor,5
3278,"not good as usual one, the code you provided can not work, I had to debug againand the instructions for the assignments are not concrete as the last two courses",1
3279,"A massive amount of content to cover, some of it quite advanced.The exercises become fraught if your code is out of sync with the tutor's code. Things won't work, you won't know why, and there's no real recovery from that.",3
3280,I didnt know anything about Angular. Now I feel confident with the skills learned. Great instructor. Funny,5
3281,no basics being taught! straight away code snippets are pasted.,1
3282,This course was really helpful in understanding the basic functionalities in angular js.Looking forward to learning more in the next few days,5
3283,great course,4
3284,Enjoyed the course. It really increased my skills,5
3285,"Very nice course, but it would be even better if it was about Angular 2, since it is to become the standard AngularJS is/was.",4
3286,Good course,5
3287,"Excellent course on Front-End JavaScript Frameworks. Covers a wide range of web development topics and tools that can easily overwhelm first-time takers. Professor Jogesh is a great instructor who knows his stuff and explains everything thoroughly. Students may have to take this class twice to really soak in the material, and this is just the front-end side of web development!",5
3288,"also, good course but not free to access the assignment",4
3289,"That course is very useful to became a Fullstack Web developer. Of course, a lot of work to be done but in the end - a full respect of yourself and ""..a sigh of relief"" (by Professor J.Muppala) :-D",5
3290,"A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with! If there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) Yo / Yeoman: This part of the course was more of an ""Obligatory"" lecture, just to say it's mentioned. I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual ""training"" on the ins and outs. I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of ""Follow Along"", but it really felt rushed and more of an ""Obligatory"" thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories. Keep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, and Server Side Development with Node.js still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses. As it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is. When should I use a factory? When should I use a service? Which is better suited for what task? All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me.",3
3291,"Angular JS is a crucial component of all of the internet. Hardly a website exists without it and it's clear that Angular will go places. However, this course fails on a few crucial levels. As such, my review might look scathing and I'll detail why in a minute, but I want you to know that this course is quite possibly invaluable when it comes to web development. Besides, the fixes that would need to be made on the instructor's side are minor, but when working without those fixes, things get infuriatingly frustrating rather quickly.There are errors in the code supplied by the instructor that need to be pointed out by students, scripts sometimes don't work, explanations are sub-par when explaining things such as $scope. There are parts that are seemingly there to pad out the lessons such as Task Runners. Sometimes, doing things exactly the way shown in the video with additional fixes by both the professor and students, it still doesn't work. Some exercises are an hour long for something that won't be quizzed in the end.Understanding that this review was made about a new course that covers something rapidly changing and not persistent, I still did learn a lot of valuable things and I would recommend this course to everyone involved in web development. However, be prepared to question your own sanity, your skills, the software you use, software in general and just despair at times. All in all, it is a price worth paying for the amazing knowledge you gain.",2
3292,"Amazing Course , i recommend it !",5
3293,very good course,5
3294,"Very Nice Course. Takes us through everything and enables us with basic promised objective. Good Luck to Course creators, keep adding more to it.",4
3295,I would recommend the full specialization for anyone interested in web field,5
3296,great hands on course materialgreat delivery by prof. Muppala,5
3297,Very good. i liked this course. Thank you.,5
3298,Great course,4
3299,Excellent! Especially after taking previous course on Bootstrap and JQuery and realize how same website can be converted to AngularJS easily and why this is better.,5
3300,Not happy with this course.,1
3301,Great course. I had a lot of fun. Structure of the course is very good.,5
3302,Good course,5
3303,The teacher is very good! He explains very well and the material is very carefully prepared. Great Course!,5
3304,Awesome course! Expecting Angular2 or React taught by this amazing teacher,5
3305,"A good introduction to AngularJS, but falls short on connecting the dots in places.",4
3306,It was really a extremely good course.,5
3307,"The teacher is very comprehensive and very serious and provides a lot of supplementary reading materials, I like it very much.",5
3308,"Angular 1 not Angular 2 which is disappointing but worse still, it teaches use of scope which is no longer recommended by the angular team themselves.Could be vastly improved by using modern angular best practice such as ""Controller As"" syntax and teaching you to write code that is more ""compatible"" with Angular 2",2
3309,"Pros: a lot of good content, worth 8 weeks of study, so good bang for the buck. Takes modular approach, where things are gradually taken apart and shown how to improve using another Angular module or approach.Cons: can be a little academical, very time-intensive.I have a much better understanding now of MVC concept using JS framework.",4
3310,"Excellent course, thank you very much teacher for its depth on the issues and passion for what he does !!",5
3311,good course,5
3312,Very good course. Absolutely recommendable.,5
3313,Great course!,5
3314,So good i love it so much . Thank you,5
3315,very practical,4
3316,"This course is deceivingly full of content. If you want to get through this course you need to have a lot of time on your hands because of the shear amount of debugs your code will produce even if you follow the steps to the letter. So many things are taught over a 4 week period that if you do not do the extra reading to understand what is happening you will get an overview of angularjs, bower, gulp, grunt, yo, yeoman and so on without really knowing how to use any of these tools again. Also because of the number of interdependent parts to the application you create, when the professor decides to give you one of the html or js files again to do an assignment, chances are everything will break and you will spend a long time figuring out which variables' names have been changed and blabla...The professor does not give you a good basis for debugging your code, you need to modify the set up of gulp to show understandable stack traces to figure out what is going wrong.If you want a challenging course where you have to go the extra mile learning things from documentation and blogs to substitute the lack of detail in order to complete the course, than this is the course for you!I think this course needs to be restructured and the length increased to 6 weeks instead of 4, with more detailed content and understand of each tool and especially more on angularjs",3
3317,Very good course and teacher!,5
3318,"Excellent course, the professor is fantastic with his explanations and the course gives a great foundation to build upon.",5
3319,My First course with Coursera . loved it.,5
3320,Great,5
3321,The great one!,5
3322,Very good. Thank you,5
3323,"Not a bad course, but videos must be shorter. Divide 30-40 min videos into small ones",4
3324,Very good course.. Assignments should be independent of lectures to test understanding.,5
3325,great class,5
3326,"Update:Coursera or the course content provider has changed this course in a bad way: You have to PAY for the course IN FULL AMOUNT JUST to get your assignments submitted and reviewed by peer learner.What a pity.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great course! Material is very useful and interesting!The course introduces concepts in a progressive and comprehensive way so that knowledge is easy to be understood. Practise quiz and assignments perfectly reflects course materials.Also, professor Muppala is quite funny. Enjoy the course!",2
3327,best angular course I have seen,5
3328,"Amazing, nothing less :)",5
3329,Amazing course. Helped learn a new framework very quickly :D,5
3330,It is a good course to know AngulerJS,5
3331,"The course is very good, the teacher very clear, easy to follow. In yet it is a basic course",4
3332,"excellent course, assignments and marvelous teacher. Though an example of writing personal directive would be a nice addition.",5
3333,What better way to understand angular JS than doing hands on project. The transformation of entering into learning angular JS with bootstrap is something I loved about this course. Thank you Professor Jogesh Muppala. It is a great learning experience.,5
3334,Very interesting course,5
3335,Great course. A lot of information in lectures and detailed tasks for assignments. The course gives the review and the basis of Angular and helps to create your own Angular application. Thanks,5
3336,Really the best!!! But It will be good if lecture includes some errors we can make and silly mistakes which affects results adversely. Jogesh sir is very good teacher and he is clear and brief in less time,5
3337,"Great teacher, AngularJS it's awesome...",5
3338,Top,5
3339,Very very good course!!,5
3340,Very good course,5
3341,"Takes a bit of time to get adjusted to the workflow. It's a bit trial and error, especially if your using Windows. Best bet is to use a unix-terminal so if you have windows use a terminal like Git Bash. Overall it's a very good course and gets you into the meat and bones of Web Development. Just remember to come with patience and do things on time :).",5
3342,Nice course for beginners,5
3343,Very helpful course,5
3344,"Superb guidance, hands-on project, rich extensions and ample opportunities for learning new things.One of the best specializations!",5
3345,Best Angular and task runners course!,5
3346,"Well Organized, and very informative and practical course. Touches as well on the important concepts like dependency injection design pattern and its use in Angular JS.",5
3347,I really enjoyed this course; it has given me a really good platform of AngularJS to build upon.,5
3348,This instructor is awesome.,5
3349,it 's amzing AngularJS's course and a good teacher ... Thank you,5
3350,Good to begin with Angular,4
3351,Great course...,5
3352,Pity that people had to spend more time on making the plugins work than actually doing the exercises/assignments but good content nonetheless.,3
3353,"I will rate this course 5 star.. it contains good explanation of all MVC components in angularEveryone related to the feild of web designing should do this courseThank you ,prof. Jogesh K. Muppala",5
3354,Very good course overall. It could dig into a little more detail but given the duration and workload it's still pretty good. I think it's targeted towards people who are either working or studying full-time and taking this on the side.,4
3355,"Thank you for this great course. Great teacher, really useful assignment which push my skills to understand more of angular's way. Very recommended",5
3356,Great class. Very in depth.,5
3357,"Overall, this is a very effective introduction to AngularJS. AngularJS can be intimidating or confusing, and this course is largely an introduction, but the videos and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve. This course will give you a thorough foundation in AngularJS, way better than any other free course online, and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if you're interested in going on to develop intermediate skills.My only critique of this course is that I really had to explore the ""additional materials"" at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts. I found that some of the videos oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and weren't thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises. I also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developers and doesn't do a good job of explaining their value (like Grunt and Gulp).However, this course is still amazing for a free course. If you've done any of the quick tutorials in AngularJS (like codeacademy's), you've really only scratched the surface of AngularJS. A hands-on course like this give you a much better foundation. To conclude, despite it's minor flaws, this is still the best free introduction to AngularJS online today. Good luck!",4
3358,"Great combination of theory and practical, gives good understanding of angular and framework.",5
3359,"Professor's lecture is pretty good, and assignment is well designed.",5
3360,"Hard work, I had to watch most of the videos at least twice so took much more time than I anticipated. I'm glad I stuck with it because it made the start of the next course much easier. Very satisfying to have completed it.",4
3361,"The course is very good. My only point of concern is the installation procedures of packages, where the instructor either is installing an old package or not using any new installation procedures causing students to have a whole lot of issues with setting up their development environment",4
3362,"The perfect course to start learning about Angular, the professor is incredible, full recommended this course, It help me a lot.",5
3363,Excellent course well explained everything . I liked the additional resources also.,5
3364,"Great course, just a few hiccups along the way with setting up environments. Had I not read a bit in the Discussion Forums before I started this course, I would've done the course on Windows and encounter all the problems my classmates did with setting up a development environment on Windows. Students should be advised to do this course on Linux or on a Mac.",4
3365,Provides a thorough knowledge but could be extended to one more week to cover testing part.,4
3366,"Very well explained, great teacher!",5
3367,Really good course to get your feet wet! A good mix of theory and exercises. Loved it!,5
3368,"This course is good only for newbies and very high-level. No advanced info about Angrular. No tricks. No info about custom directives, $watch, digest cycle, etc. I had expected more detailed course",3
3369,Great course with excellent lections and homeworks.,5
3370,Great course. Jogesh has done wonderful job in designing the hands on exercises.,5
3371,a very good introduction to angularJS,5
3372,"You get to learn a lot about AngularJS and other tools. I enjoyed learning this course. It was demanding at times but in the process you get to learn a lot of things, so it was rewarding.",5
3373,"This one was much tougher than the previous two courses. Out of four weeks, I ended up delivering my assignments overdue on three occasions, which really has not impact on your grade, but it shows that this time around it is a bit more difficult to complete them. AngularJS is the bread and butter in the industry. All in all, I would say you could already code a basic website from head to toe, including very basic server setup, after completing this class.",5
3374,Good Angular exercises. But I think that testing should get its own segment. Becomes a bit lengthy with 30 min videos and only scraping the surface on the subject.,4
3375,"The course is nice, however the assignments are the same every time and the pace is too slow. The final week suddenly too compact, and testing/yo is not assigned at all.",4
3376,Excellent course. I will follow also some others or all the next courses of this specialization.,5
3377,Very good course and very pleasant Professor !,4
3378,Excellent Course. Good teaching and coverage of wide range of topics.,5
3379,"Very good overview and step by step dive into this javascript framework.The instructor knows how to deliver one piece of information at a time and with simple exercices to put it into practice.The assignments are not very hard, but they give you confidence in what you have learned.",5
3380,The progression in this course is amazing! You will see how your web page is transformed beautifully into different modules. MVC concept is clearly illustrated and implemented in this course.,5
3381,Great course.Gived me a good knowledge and understanding of an AngularJs.I would like to take all the courses of this specialisation.,5
3382,good course,5
3383,"FAntastic course. With a great illustration, you progressively build a full dynamic website using json server.",5
3384,Nice Course helped me to learn Angular JS,5
3385,just love the fact that there is a course on angularJS,5
3386,Very amazing course!,5
3387,Very good lesson! With good material and good explanation of everything!,5
3388,Love it,5
3389,"Tougher than the Bootstrap course, but it was worth it.",4
3390,A very good course.I did not have such an experience even in the classroom.The course was fantastic.Thank you from the heart to all teachers and the coursera community.,5
3391,Great course.,5
3392,Really good course!,5
3393,"Good explanation with examples.Few examples need changes in gulp file to run and view the output. For beginners, it may be tough to understand and make changes. Please handle it.",5
3394,"Jogesh K. Muppala is a great professor, funny, entertaining and knowledgeable. The examples he provides work well and offer a great introduction to Angular.",5
3395,"Fun course, learn how to create a basic Angular website without getting too overwhelmed.",5
3396,simply a great course! it's long but the time dedicated to it os worth it.,5
3397,"Highly recommended for beginners! The professor explain concepts in a neat, well-paced and clear manner. There's ample support for all the assignments too!",4
3398,"Was very difficult to follow. This is a complex subject and the prof is trying his best, but there are times the explanation is not sufficient. Instructions for installing gulp was not good. I was unable to complete the following exercises after gulp installation failed. Instruction needs to be short and crisp. Building on top of each other project has its negative. There must be solution at the end or at least a check point where you can start clean for the next project.",2
3399,The course is escellent! The teacher is excellent!,5
3400,Thanks for this introduction to AngularJS.Unfortunately we have to pay in order to obtain a certificate of accomplishment.,4
3401,"Great course, didactial and very well explained",5
3402,"More on Angular, less on Gulp and Grunt. Lectures about them are so tedious, and when you need them you get the finished code and modify it via tutorial :)",4
3403,"Too long videos, you should make more short videos, instead of one boring long video. You speak too slow and that makes a 8 minutes video turns into 30 minutes video.",1
3404,steps for exercises are not clear.,3
3405,Good Course. Cleared lots of doubts I had about Angular. Respect the professor. Thank you very much.,5
3406,Much more than I expected from the course organizers. Great work!,5
3407,This course is amazing. I am learning a lot with Mr. Muppala. Thank you!,5
3408,great teacher with an solid approach . the course is full of exercises and built in a way to increment as bigger project .Excellent !!!,5
3409,Good course for the introduction to Angular JS,5
3410,Great course for beginners. Very well explained. Thanks!,5
3411,The course is amazing! The only thing I'd like to be corrected is the subtitles. There are lots of mistakes that disturb our learning.,5
3412,Good and useful course! Try it!,5
3413,"Very interesting course and very well structured. The subjects are handled with the correct depth corresponding to its importance. The indicated time spent by week corresponds accurately to the time needed, if you have some previous experience in web development.The exercises are focused in the important details and very well organized.If you have interest in client side web development and particularly in Angular, this is a very good opportunity to learn.Probably in a near future this course must be updated to cover Angular 2.0.It really worth the time spent!",4
3414,Awesome course,5
3415,An excellent course! Thank you so much for providing wonderful explanations to all the lectures!,5
3416,"As the rest of the courser, this one is another example of a good job",5
3417,The most relevant course I have done in Coursera,5
3418,The paste of the lectures is too slow. Much too slow,2
3419,Great course. Very methodical and a great example of incremental learning. Every assignment built on the previous assignment and I always felt I was being very well guided through my first learning experience with Angularjs.,5
3420,"Awesome course content, nice explanation by the tutor. Must for beginners who want to have a start with AngularJS, grunt, gulp and other tools.",5
3421,A very well explained course,5
3422,"Good course, especially good is coverent grunt and gulp which is very useful, also angular is covered very well for start. I learned a lot, even if i have some of angular knowledge.",5
3423,Great course. Lots of hands on tasks,5
3424,Great course and very good explanations of the concepts.,5
3425,Great introduction to Angular! Learnt a lot.,4
3426,very good teacher and good hard working course,5
3427,"Great course. Well explained, well prepared.Thank you!",5
3428,super detailed and professional materials!,5
3429,This course is very well done and gives a very good understanding of angular framework.,5
3430,"great course!week 4 a little bit overloaded of topics, but still great",5
3431,"Excellent course, this course is very well planned and covered a lot of ground. In additional to angular itself, it covers the tooling, automation test utilities that support angular, this make the course very practical and in-depth. Professor Muppala designs this specification very well and make it easy to follow, but yet learning the important detail.",5
3432,Jogesh Muppala did a great job in this course!Angular simple and direct,5
3433,"I think it's a very good introduction to AngularJS. You learn and understand what you're doing in almost lessons. I'd hardly recommend it to any beginner !!!I found that the 4rth week was very very compressed. You could spend 1 more week explaining all the Front-End tools such as Gulp, Grunt, Yo (Yeoman) etc. And go deeper with the AngularJS as well.In some points I felt myself alone with no teacher support regardless there's a students forum. I'd improve the transparency and the communication teacher-student.Anyway I very happy to spent that time on this course he explains really paciently :D",4
3434,Very good course as for me!,5
3435,"Very good course, just a few notes short of excelence.",4
3436,"I liked this course, especially in the way is built. The subject was not so easy but anyway, thanks to the organization of lectures and exercises, i was able to achieve the target.The teacher is good and clear in the explanation.",5
3437,"Although a good introduction course, sometime is focus on javascript tools rather than on AngularJS itself which, in hand, looses time and doesn't explain/give examples on how to create directives and filters, which are two core functionalities of this framework.",3
3438,Very useful course.,5
3439,Excellent course. Going through all the exercises and doing the assignments was a great way to get introduced to Front-end development for me.,5
3440,Great Course,5
3441,"Dr Muppala and HKUST have produced a real winner here. The lecture material is explained very well, and the exercises are carefully crafted to focus your attention on the current lesson without being distracted by stuff that is not necessarily relevant. The course builds on previous courses, but those are not necessarily required for understanding this one -- it stands on its own. By the end of the course, the student should have a clear understanding of how Angular.js works, what are its strengths and weaknesses, and how to build applications using this tool set. Supporting tools (build tools, test tools) are also covered.",5
3442,Lecturer make the course more interesting !!,5
3443,Great course! Excellent teacher!,5
3444,"A lot of material for one course. Would appreciate more discussion of package managers, how to find packages that may be useful.",4
3445,The homework is the best practice for hands on. Excellent material,5
3446,Very useful course!,5
3447,Just Excelent! Thank you all the people who did this possible! I learned a lot! :D,5
3448,Great course for overview of Angular JS and other useful techologies connecte,5
3449,"Pretty good coverage of Angular as whole, how to setup a Angular project, and how it fits into bigger picture web development.Criticisms:- Overall, the code presentation (in exercises, provided files, and the slides) was ugly. Good looking and properly styled code is important to ingrain, and this course fell pretty short there. Code was (very) poorly indented, had inconsistent single vs. double quotes, and didn't follow any style guide out there. Use some beautifier and make sure jshint doesn't have any suggestions for improvement! Slides need at least some monospaced font; better would be colored code snippets or screenshots.- The Gulp and Grunt week felt pretty strangely structured. The two task runners just had such long lectures videos that it was a really big hump to get over, especially since we didn't use Grunt later.- (harder to fix) My files got pretty inconsistent with what I needed to copy/download over week-by-week from the course. Some sort of git repository and easier way to pull changes would be good. I ended up version controlling every week and every week's assignment.So yeah, I'd say this was worth taking, but some parts of the setup are pretty frustrating and version controlling makes life much easier.",4
3450,"The course is excellent; however, it requires more time than promised...",4
3451,"Amount of AngularJS topics covered by the course is too small. All assignments are very typical, just copy-paste from lecture exercises.",3
3452,Easy to follow course with raising complexity. Same example from the beginning helping to better understand the need for different tools and objects. Very well structured and even fun to follow,5
3453,"This course had some rough spots here and there, but taking it as a whole, I still give it 5 stars. Why?a) The professor. Professor Jogesh has a great sense of humour and was entertaining enough to keep the classes lively and entertaining to the end. (Even if I did play the video at 2x speed most of the time :)b) The forums. There were a lot of experienced dudes on the forums who were willing to help out with bugs and any configuration issues. The professor also appeared on the forums from time to time. That's gold dust when learning a topic for the first time.c) Depth and pace of coverage. A lot of different topics were introduced and covered well enough for me to be able to use them in my projects and to further explore them without feeling overwhelmed.d) The assignments. They were not too daunting, but were excellent to drive home key points covered in the lectures.e) Peer review of assignments. I learnt some good techniques by reviewing the code of more experienced fellow classmates taking the course.f) Most important of all, the structure and pace of the course were balanced well enough for me to stay with it and to feel that I'd learnt a lot by its end. You will not be an AngularJS expert after 4 weeks, but will have covered relevant subtopics in enough depth to be able to progress further with confidence.",5
3454,Very good course !,5
3455,Great Course!! A Must!!,5
3456,"Interesting content, but sooo slow. 20 minutes long videos could have been done in 5 minutes. Moreover, the teacher's voice and tone did nothing to make the content live.",2
3457,very interesting and well structured! i'm interested in one more specialized now!,5
3458,Thank you Professor Muppala. I learned lot of thinks and enjoyed this course.I was able to complete all the assignment with the help of this tutorials.It is organized in a very good manner.,5
3459,Very detailed and interesting,5
3460,"Very good Course , professor makes course very easy.",5
3461,It is good course to learn Angular JS for beginner. It explained well how to use web tools with angular and how to start with it.,5
3462,"I love the style of the courses in this specialization. The exercises are useful and set you up for the assignments. I also really appreciate how the instructor guides you in the use of tools like bower, grunt, gulp and yo, and that he takes the time to cover unit and end-to-end testing. Looking forward to the next course!",5
3463,Very practical approach to teach AngularJS,4
3464,Great course. Very useful,5
3465,"Excellent teacher! Excellent discipline and way of teaching, being practical, critic and a lot fun.I'm really enjoy all the courses. This teacher is essencial to the course success.",5
3466,"Very useful material, the professor teaches it at a good pace and at an easy to understand level, the exercises are easy to follow and replicating the professor's steps is very simple (except for the Gulp steps, but that's not graded anyway), so you can follow how he did what he did",5
3467,"Excellent course! All the material was relevant and the exerises were challenging without being impossible. Professor Muppala is a very entertaining instructor. All three courses in the specialization so far have exceeded expectations. The only remark so far is the subpar quality of the subtitles in this course. There were many mistakes in nearly every video. Other than that, great work!",5
3468,I missed a lot of it because many NPM modules wouldn't install on my Windows environment. :(,4
3469,A well-organized course that makes you do the puzzles one by one.,5
3470,Excellent Course and Excellent Teacher,5
3471,It's a good course to start with this technology,5
3472,"Fantastic course, all explained very clearly",5
3473,its a great course with so much to learn in a short period. course is well structured and intructor knows his stuff. the assignments are well designed to reinforce the presentations,5
3474,Good Course,5
3475,"What an awesome course. The teacher is top-class, really knows the subject, and how to continually explain each module. The video exercises are just made for the student to grasp the content. One of the best courses I hev experienced on Coursera.",5
3476,"Great course, I had a lot of fun",5
3477,Very good course,5
3478,After completion I got a pretty good understanding about AngularJS and its features.,5
3479,very very very very good course. I learned quite a lot from it. Thanks Professor.,5
3480,I liked this Course. Now i am familiar with AngularJS. Thank you,5
3481,Great Course and really great professor,5
3482,"Good introduction to AngularJS. Moreover their provide a wide variety of additional information related to the course, which is very useful to enlarge the basic contents studied.",4
3483,awesome course!!!,5
3484,great course,5
3485,"Very good course. It allows to learn the basics of angular js very fast and easily. I only missed a little more of content in directives scopes, but here you can learn a lot.",4
3486,Amazing material and teaching style excellent!,5
3487,Great teacher. Great Angular overview. I wish the instruction went deeper into Angular than it did.,4
3488,"Covers End 2 End web application development with AngularJS,Learned a lot and got me going with web app development.",5
3489,This is an awesome course! Many interesting and useful topics were taught. I'm looking forward for your next courses.,5
3490,Great Course,5
3491,I love this instructor.,5
3492,Great course !,5
3493,"NIce and very usefull course to get started with angular and web tools such as grunt, gulp and yeoman",5
3494,"Clear, Pleasant and Useful!",5
3495,Very good course and very well organized. Is a must if you want you want to learn angular from the begining.,5
3496,Excellent course for beginners .,5
3497,Great course!,5
3498,One of the best tutorial!!!! You will never regret :),5
3499,Awesome course! I have learned so much!,5
3500,"The professor is really great, very clear and understandable course.",5
3501,Excellent Course.Just Superb.Great Professor.,5
3502,it was excellent,5
3503,"I have completed 2 MOOCs till but am very happy with the new curriculum,dividing the course into small modules.I am showing interest when am watching videos,clear explanation and fully satisfied with this course.Thank you",5
3504,Excellent course!!Easy to follow..course organisation is really good. :-),5
3505,We have a very cool Profesor on this course!If you think AngularJS is hard to learn you will change your mind after this course!Thank you Jogesh K. Muppala for sharing your knowledge!,5
3506,Great course and professor.,5
3507,Very nice course teaches you a real life examples.Lots of thanks to the trainer because i do understand in a very easy way.,5
3508,Very good tutorials...,5
3509,The course is very boring and monotonous. It should be made more engaging. One needs to capture the concentration of students for a subject like Angular.,1
3510,i like a javascript. and i really thanks to hong kong university for this course and coursera.org also.,5
3511,Very comprehensive course,5
3512,"I was able to grasp the overview of the course. The instructions are delivered well and the flow seems in order. However my lack of background with the topic discussed cause me to stop watching everything. Plus, I can't do the said assignment because I am a beginning on this topic. it seems this is not a course for me to rate based on content. However I will rate it in terms of the aesthetic, organization or structure of the slides .The organization of the content of the slides needs to be properly organized. Long paragraphs are a pain to read. Further when comparing, two concepts, it is easier to comprehend when they are in table form. For instance in FrontEnd JavaScript Framework Overview video, it is better in terms of organization and aesthetic to show library vs. framework in table form.Also, the volume of Introduction to AngularJS video is too loud. Though I can adjust it and lower the volume, but sudden high volume sound is discouraging when the next video has normal volume causing me to adjust it again.I was only able to watch few of the videos but they are good. Just a little improvement needed.",3
3513,Great course!,5
3514,This class is very clear and easy to understand! Thank you for providing such feast for students!,5
3515,"I love how this course delves into a very promising advanced research topic in Computational Complexity. It helps me a lot to understand trending publications in the area. Specially that the material is presented in an incremental approach. This way a researcher can live through the evolution of ideas. It is inspiring also in the way one comes up with a partial solution for the special case, and then generalizes with approximation factor that is satisfyingly good. I'm looking forward to more advanced courses in parameterized, streaming or quantum algorithms.",5
3516,"good course, with many examples and explanations",5
3517,"Content of the course is great. However , at time assignments are very difficult to understand. There are probably very few students who take this course at any time , so you dont get much help from forums. TA's and Professor as well have not responded to any of our questions. I dont expect any course to be cakewalk but at least some help need to be provided.",4
3518,"The assignments could be a bit improved (some are less good, I would personally complain about knapsack), but in general it is a great course, as it gives an accessible introduction to approximation algorithms (for NP-hard problems), which is a very relevant topic, as NP-hard problems are everywhere.At the time of writing (end summer 2016), it is also a unique course for this very relevant topic.",5
3519,"Very interesting, explanations are clear and easy to understand",4
3520,"Lectures and content were great. The theme of the course is to provide insight into the approaches used to investigate approximation algorithms for NP hard problems and the theoretical techniques used to assess the effectiveness of the approximation algorithm against the best answer. The production quality of the lecture videos and slides was high.The content of the quizzes and assignments was mostly appropriate and well organized. However, the authors appeared to struggle with the platform. At times there were comments such as, you need to enter something in the box but it was not actually being used. Answers to the assignments required using substantial mathematical notation, but LaTex was not enabled in the discussion or text entry boxes (no longer available in the Coursera platform??) so the work around was to upload answers to a bunch of questions as a single PDF document. Flow of the individual modules (lectures, slides, quizzes) was inconsistent, varying from week to week.",4
3521,This was a relatively easy but well paced introduction to approximation algorithms. I totally enjoyed it.,5
3522,"Excellent advanced course! Not for beginner in computer science, nor for people more interested in applying computer science than in theoretical foundations.",5
3523,"This course covers the basic ground about approximation algorithms and would be very valuable for a practitioner, but seems designed for people who already know the materials and is more theoretical than applied.Lectures are very abstract --with a description of the problem and a formal description of the solution--, there are few examples with step-by-step tracing of algorithms --that is how the algorithm actually works to solve the problem--, and a significant amount of expertise is assumed --so much so, that you wouldn't need this course. For example, there are questions about ""approximation ratio"", but it is not explained. This seems like something that is inherent to approximation algorithms, but is only asked in the exams/project, and is not even mentioned in the lectures. Similar issues abound around the course.",2
3524,Excellent Course! I have learnt a lot about Approximation Algorithms in a short span of time.,5
3525,"Great class, and Professor Claire Mathieu is doing an excellent job!",5
3526,A really good course for programmers who want to take a bit deeper into CS.,5
3527,"Lectures are well-organized. Some assignments (e.g., Assignment 3, which involves merely understanding an algorithm, rather than proving correctness and approx. ratio) are extraordinarily stupid and somewhat tangential.",4
3528,"Really good course, the material is quite advanced but very well structured and introduced in a very simple way. The assignments were a lot of fun: really enjoyed the peer-graded assignments where I needed to write short proofs, much more useful than regular multiple-choice answers. Looking forward to the next course!",5
3529,A useful course which introduces key ideas in Approximation Algorithms. Looking forward to part II.,5
3530,The course provides a high-level introduction to approximation algorithm. There is no programming assignments but it provides nice introduction to approximation algorithm.,5
3531,"The course deals not with programming, but rather with designing and analyzing approximation algorithms. The course is on a high level and focuses on the subject without too much side remarks on applications, connections to other subjects or motivational introductions. If you are a theory person, however, you will probably enjoyed it.",5
3532,Very high-level course. After week1 and I'm already excited to start it,5
3533,"This course is quite advanced and the assignments require prerequisite skills to prove time complexity etc. If you are upto it, then for sure take this course. The instructor is quite thorough.",4
3534,awesome course!I'd like to see part 2 and other graduate-level algorithms courses on coursera.,5
3535,very nice course. i look forward to the second part!,5
3536,"This class is the one I am seeking for a long time. Theories of Combinatorial optimization and associated approximation algorithms involve lots of hot research topics in machine learning, image processing, and Bioinformatics. The faculty for this course is a leading expert in the related fields.",5
3537,"Excellente course, thank you for the excellent techniques and approach that often lacks in courses on the subject.I would have loved a validation at least.I'd be very happy to attend another of your class should you make a part 3 or another lecture.",5
3538,Even better than the first! Very good classes (except for the two first of week 3 ...),5
3539,Learning Approximation algorithm by self is really hard. Fortunately this class is very easy to understand useful techniques such as primal-dual linear programming and SDP. Thank you very much!,5
3540,Demanding course with lots of great algorithm concepts based on Linear Programming.,5
3541,"This course covers challenging technical topics and I appreciate that the effort that went into making it. That said I have serious concerns about the quality of execution for Part II of the course, which was much inferior to part I of the course.In general, the lectures themselves were up to the quality of part I and are well done. In many cases, the practice quizzes were less helpful. Including one sequence where each quiz extended the previous one but if you there was no way to learn from your errors, especially an error in the first quiz.For the peer graded assignments, there was one answer field for multiple questions, rather than one per question. Worse, the answers often required equations and LaTex math was not available. The only solution was to put the answers in a document on a cloud drive like Google Drive and paste a link in. Finally, for the peer review you could just mark questions correct or wrong with no way to provide private feedback on what was lacking in a response. Furthermore, doing the peer review was purely optional and the results were not actually scored. (Part 1 was similar, but it was possible to upload the document to Coursera directly and peer review was a required part of the course, resulting in a grade.) Either there are serious limitations with this iteration of the Coursera platform or the course authors did not understand how to properly implement this.Finally, in the session I took their was no active Teaching Assistance presence. There were no responses to student questions nor concerns that were raised about typos and possible errors in the quizzes and problem assignments. Either the course should not have been offered if no TA support was available or there should have been some notification in syllabus that this session would only have peer assistance with no support from the course staff.",2
3542,It is remarkable to note that Professor Claire Mathieu explains such a complex subject in such a elegant and understandable manner.,5
3543,"Good info, lots to think about",4
3544,Very interesting course about the aging process and how living in different areas can really affect your longevity and your health in your senior years. It was enjoyable to read papers from other students on how their lives are now and what they are planning in the future.,5
3545,This is an interesting topic which I have never really given a thought before. Eye-opening and really make you think,4
3546,It is a wonderful COURSE,5
3547,I thought this was an excellent course that looked at trends in aging populations from many perspectives. The reflections were thought provoking and the assignments helped reinforce a serious approach to the course.,5
3548,TOO MUCH Peer rating too little hard information,1
3549,Very well structured course.,4
3550,Excellent job! Learning various search algorithms with diverse applications in real life.,5
3551,A great and 'must-do' course for all beginners.,5
3552,Great,5
3553,Good introduction to Data Structures with Java examples,5
3554,"I thought the course was an outstanding treatment of data structures and algorithms. The instructors advance to more complex structures and algorithms as the student progresses. I never felt overwhelmed at any stage, and by the end of the course, I was impressed with how much new material we had covered.",5
3555,Very good course. I wish we could have done more algorithms with the map. Such a great way to teach algorithms.,5
3556,Great learning!,5
3557,"It was really great course ,well designed and challenging .",5
3558,Course teams really spend a lot of time for providing a great studying experience and procedure.,5
3559,"UCSD always bring there A game, with fun projects and extensions to real world problems. I have completed all three courses.This course was especially informative as it dipped into the graph theory and the optimization problems we face.The course itself is fun and informative and may seem tough at times but is really rewarding once complete. Thanks guys and girls.",5
3560,"Great faculty, great course, great practical project!",5
3561,"Great Instructors...Thank you Instructors,google engineers, coursera and UCSD.",5
3562,Really helpful the course was.,5
3563,nice course. very well organised and presented. good refresher of ADS in Java,5
3564,"The projects are fun, but the course is too short and abbreviated.",4
3565,Greate course! It was really fun and really difficult for me.,5
3566,So So.Not good to learn an algorithm,3
3567,Really fun,5
3568,"Another course handled excellently in the series. All the lectures and topics were really effective in introducing weighty concepts, but making it much easier to work with them through clear explanations. Super knowledgeable instructers, assignments and quizzes helped contribute to some solid learning through the course. The course was put together really well, thanks!",5
3569,"Overall, I enjoyed this course. Especially from week 1 to 3 where the course contents were simply amazing.It would be great if week 4 and 5 can engage the students like week 1 to 3, and the forum can be more alive.Thank you.",4
3570,Excellent material and instructors,5
3571,"This is a really useful course. The project is quite relevant, and the work with breadth first search, Dijkstra, and A* Search are really interesting!",4
3572,Challenging class and well-designed course for intermediate Java programmers.,5
3573,Very well structured,5
3574,This course was excellent! I learned so much and I am now able to understand the significance of knowing how Algorithms and Data Structures are related in a practical way. I,4
3575,Very well designed class by 3 great professors!,5
3576,The last 2 lessons did not have much content. Particularly there was no practical assessment on traveling salesman,3
3577,Fantastic Course,5
3578,"It would be very, very beneficial if maybe one or two more videos were added to dive in-depth into ADTs and their method callback run-time analysis. Aside from that this class was educational and interesting as expected.",5
3579,"Super awesome course, love the professors, would've been even better if covered hashing in more detail.",5
3580,I think it would be better if the lectures can go a little bit deeper on the topics in this course.,4
3581,Very nice course for clearing the concept of the advanced search algorithm and applying them in the real world scenario. Well designed course and programming materials.,5
3582,Wonderful Course. This has very good explanation of Data Structures,5
3583,"its hard, but intresting",5
3584,Nicely explained and challenging projects.,4
3585,Very interesting and adaptative for the student as you can catch another later session.I found there's a huge gap between week1 and week2.Thanks,5
3586,Good course!,5
3587,"Good course. The example application is fun (looking at graph data structures as part of route planning in a Google Maps based app) - and there is room to experiment. I continue to enjoy the instructors, who present well and have obviously done a good job preparing the material. Much fun!",5
3588,"The first 3 weeks are really good, 5 stars. Weeks 4 and 5 are way too light. Week 4 has no programming assignment and a short class and 5 has a weak programming assignment and no class.",3
3589,Now i understand how gps planing routes work! I really like Data Structures and the importance of Graphs,5
3590,"Loved it. Once again the skeleton code provided and course material was great. It was once again introducing new concepts which were never part of BASIC, FORTRAN or DELPHI. So I enjoyed the pain of having to get my head around the objects and code.Thanks !!!!",5
3591,I understood about graphs from here at last after trying various resources online but peace was attained here in this course,5
3592,Really nice finish to the specialization.,4
3593,I give really high marks for this course as the graphs are presented in a proper and practical manner. I have a suggestion to present the High Level of Graphs more in the area of Information theory. Otherwise it is nice approach and very good implementation of the material and exams.,4
3594,"awesome course , gave me lot of confidence thanks a lot",5
3595,"The course content and presentation was excellent. I love the large-project format of the classes in this specialization. I only wish this course had more resources for working offline, at a level that matches the previous courses in the specialization.",4
3596,good job however I think it was quite short and quite shallow,4
3597,This is an awesome course with great stuff for learning and practical graphs concept in programming with some useful algorithms like A*.,4
3598,Great course!,5
3599,By far the best course I have ever found about Data Structures in Java.,5
3600,"I am really enjoying this course, thanks for all your efforts!",5
3601,Introduction to data structures. It wastes a week talking about theoretical complexity when it could have been used for something more productive.,3
3602,"This course is very helpful in understanding Graph, which was a pain in other courses",5
3603,A lot of work has been put into this course. You will get to learn a lot and use a lot of Java collections framework. You will also get to use concepts of Polymorphism and Inheritance if you are not already familiar with it.,5
3604,Exciting algorithm application in path-finding and routing.,5
3605,Best classes I ever took till now. This really enhanced my Java programming skills. Thank you.,5
3606,Thanks for sharing the knowledge.this course was awesome,5
3607,Excellent course. All the concepts are very well explained and the assignments are enjoyable and worthwhile. Highly recommended.,5
3608,I have really enjoyed this!,5
3609,Dijkstra and A star algorithms courses are a bit short,2
3610,Very interesting and challenging,5
3611,"The contents were pretty basic for me, but they were presented clearly. All in all I liked the review this course gave me.",4
3612,Very good series for learning Java and OO Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.This particular installment has the animation of the shortest path algorithm on the map and that's very helpful to fully understand the amount of work and the effects of optimizations in different shortest path approaches.,5
3613,"For me, it is easier to grasp algorithms that are written out than audio/video description. I would have given 5 stars if the course material accommodated different learning styles for each chapter. I had to do a fair amount of searching for information on the A Star search algorithm to the understand the subtle details.",4
3614,"It's good to start an algorithm of graph implementation. Except the first Assignment, the next following assignments are a little bit tough for me.",5
3615,Amazing course with amazing teachers .Worth every penny .,5
3616,Very nice course which gives good introduction to data structures. I love it. :),5
3617,Loved it .Best MOOC specialization I have attended.Thanks a lot!!!,5
3618,great course thanks!,5
3619,"The course is well-laid and very interesting. Even though the material is pretty difficult and advanced. As always the great talent of Christine, Mia and Leo is beyond praise.I definitely recommend this course for developers who want to improve their mastery.Many thanks for the brilliant course.",5
3620,well structured! I learnt a lot.,5
3621,"What I really enjoyed in this course was to discover how to represent streets and intersections and finally trace a path from a starting point to a destination, like a GPS! Really nice!",5
3622,As all their courses this one is great!,5
3623,Awesome course!,5
3624,Graphs now are more interesting and useful!,5
3625,Teach you the basic of graph,5
3626,Thanks a lot! Very interesting course!,5
3627,An exceptional course in intermediary programming!,5
3628,Nice one!!,5
3629,"I really like the way that the professors explain everything. I also like the project which helps me understand and memorize the algorithms by fitting them into real world problem, that I learned Dijkstra algorithm multiple times but this is the first time I feel like understanding it thoroughly and will keep it in my mind.",5
3630,"At first the course is hands on, later on it becomes more of theory. This would have been a challenging course if we had more harder graph problems to solve though.",4
3631,"The content is just amazing, and the teachers are so awesome prompted me to do more courses from UCSD",5
3632,Amazing beginner course to learn about the Graph data structure.,5
3633,The content of the course is great. By having the concept challenges and real world tie-ins the professors ensure you've absorbed the concepts.,5
3634,"Great courser, challenging assignment, but learnt a lot",5
3635,In Depth Course..,5
3636,Nice concrete course to take. Good info about graphs as a whole. Enjoyed it. :),5
3637,Good use of data structures.,5
3638,Great course.,5
3639,"The course is really way to easy. It could be done all in one day, definitely not worth 80$.",2
3640,"Challenging and fun. So glad I took this course. Made some cool changes for the extension, but I'll keep working on it just for fun!",5
3641,good course on Graph,5
3642,Very useful :),5
3643,Course was well paced. Assignments were relevant. Only shortcoming I believe was that the last two weeks of the course did not require any submission of a coding assignment. Only required a quiz.I feel that the course would benefit from a requirement to submit some code each week.,4
3644,I recommend it. It 'a complete course and allows you to explore the use of data structures with Java.,5
3645,Its awesome one,5
3646,"Very informative and learning experience. This is first time I have attended any online course. This course and coaches in the course explained things so nicely that I felt it like sitting in a class room. Entire team deserves a ""BIG"" applaud for conducting such a nice session.Course content was nicely designed and brilliantly explained. Its really worth appearing in this course.Thank you UC, San Diego !!!",5
3647,"Easy to Understand. Beautiful Course. Interesting Assignments and Quiz. Will help in my Career. Good Job by Google Engineers ,Coursera Team and the University.",5
3648,Amazing course. I have learned a lot,5
3649,This was a very useful course which covered the main fundamental aspects of graphs in Java. The assignments were very interesting and challenging as well. The lecture videos provided all the information in a very detailed manner. There was nothing more I could ask for. Overall it was a great experience!!,5
3650,"I'm graduated in System Analysis, not Computer Sciences, and learned to program only by experience. After 20 years it's a good deal but still I missed the theoretical background and this always annoyed me. I knew and used to make good use of all the structures presented in this course but never could quite explain how or why, or talk in asymptotic notations. Now I can. I didn't stop here, I do take some topics to deep dive during the lectures. It's being a great experience and I only wish I could have more time to keep myself always enrolled in some course.",5
3651,"As 2 previous courses of this specialization - the authors did a great job! I really enjoy it and learn a lot of things. The workload is perfect: not too much, so you can get things done on time, but still pretty informative and intense. The way the material is presented is beyond all expectations. I really recommend this specialization to anybody looking for a good course of algorithms in Java.",5
3652,Really coool,5
3653,Excellent! Very ambitious and well calibrated course. That can really be used for real applications.,5
3654,"Interesting things about graph algos, but I think the content should be more challengingEspecially the last two weeks, a quick quizz and a free assignment the automatically give full grade whatever the content",2
3655,Thank you. Very interesting course.,5
3656,interesting project.,5
3657,Great course. Detailed content on the graph data structure.,5
3658,"Good course to build confidence in building a class from scratch.But, I expected more from this course. A few lectures could have been devoted to popular design patterns used in Graph problems maybe.One more assignment to actually make the students work on heuristics for solving NP-Hard problems would have been helpful.",4
3659,"learning graph with Java while reviewing varieties of java advanced data structure. in a word, help me a lot.",3
3660,"Wonderful course, I will never forget the Santa example used to describe the Traveling Sales Man problem. Absolutely love all the instructors.",5
3661,Extremely well planned and interesting.,5
3662,"A few more graph algorithms and their implementations, if added to the course, would be nice.",4
3663,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about graphs and other advanced data structures.The course is really well planed and has an incredible starter code to work on.I would like to address one thing mentioned in some reviews: since the authors were focused on creating the best possible resources for the main topic of the course (and they did it remarkably well), some other data structures used in graphs (such as HashSet and PriorityQueues) seemed poorly covered, and hence it seemed there is a lack of resources for the course. But in my opinion, this was not a big issue, anyone interested could have found a bunch of free online resources. It is unrealistic to expect that the course should cover all the accompanying topics, they are just too broad. The course covers exactly what is described in its description.The only remark I have is the lack of programming assignments in the fourth week. But I am sure this can and will be easily fixed in some of the future course offerings.To conclude, based only on the knowledge I had before the course, and the knowledge I have now, this course deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating.",5
3664,"This course was very well put together. The videos were clear and well organized. They typically contained a powerpoint presentation and little box with the presenter's head. The assignments built off of each other by reusing code from previous weeks.The test cases for the grader weren't very complete. If I have any recommendations for the organizers it would be to tighten up their grading process. (For one assignment, I completely forgot to write one function and there was no test coverage for it! I ended up writing it the next week.) Still the codebase that they have provided for the class is large so I don't fault them for bugs. I think it will probably improve over time as more people take the course.Overall, they did a great job!",4
3665,Learn graph data structures through the creation of a very cool project. Awesome class!,5
3666,Splendidly covers path finding basics. Enjoyed the course.It would be great to go into advanced algorithms useful for programming challenges (like SPOJ) with the same instructors.,5
3667,Really excited for this class!,5
3668,"There is not enough background information, no reading assignments. This makes the course less understandable. Also, the examples given not related to the stated assignment",3
3669,Excellent teaching !,5
3670,"Excellent course, if a little short. the instructors did a really good job of explaining the concepts.",5
3671,Very good. Would have been even better if the course was a little more broad and more algorithms were covered.,5
3672,I learn a lot of new algorithm in graph theory and i given opportunity to apply it in a project. One of the best course in algorithm.,5
3673,This is a great course with advanced content and real world projects.,5
3674,A great course as the previous courses for the specialization. I know that the week 4's materials are out of this specialization's scope but I think it's alright to delve in more about P and NP problems. That material is somehow still incomprehensible for me.,4
3675,"Compared to the previous 2 courses, this one seemed to have been made in rush. Not enough materials covered, nor enough Java practice opportunity. The course title is misleading because it does not cover any other data structures but graph.",3
3676,Just the course I was hoping for!,5
3677,Great Courses just loving it,5
3678,"Great course, very informative and fun.",5
3679,Felt like it was a bit rushed and some of these concepts like Dijkstra definitely deserve a lot more attention.,3
3680,Very good introduction to advanced data structures in Java. This course is well designed and organized according to the cognitive psychology. Thanks!,5
3681,"Very interesting programming assignment for the BFS, Dijkstra and A* methods. Great job with that.The coverage of the TSP was weak -- room for improvement there. Perhaps include a programming assignment.Overall, the course was a worthwhile investment of time.",4
3682,The course is really amazing. Professors are great.,5
3683,Best and complete course series in course era. The best course staff of any course I have taken. The best quality of instruction and knowledge gained.Thanks to all team worked in this specialization,5
3684,"Great instructors, videos and activities. The projects are really enjoyable to enroll.",4
3685,"This is one of the best series of courses I came along in online MOOC platform, such a brilliant course, this whole specialization is brilliant, such a interesting projects, I'm disappointed that I live in country that isn't that much wealthy to help this Specialization and to be able to do Capstone Project , but I wish all the best hope to finish all in time, this is in my top 3 online MOOC Courses and I saw a lot of them.I wish all the best to this team and people that made this possible.",5
3686,The course is excellent!!,5
3687,Very easy to follow. It really gives you great tips to improve your time at work.,4
3688,Not really related to the specialization.,3
3689,It was a good course but maybe you should include more activities for reforcing the knowledge,4
3690,"I liked pretty this course. I learnt some useful skills and tactics in order to develop a negotiation. As a negative point, I found lack of examples so that understand better the theoretical issues as well as to remember better.",3
3691,good course;please make it separate from specialisation also;,5
3692,This course helped me much to understand the basics of C Programming.,4
3693,The instructor teach subjects clearly and fluently. He conveyed his experience very well. Also he prepared documentation very well. I would recommend everybody who will create projects with Arduino or Raspberry PI.,5
3694,All this peer grading nonsense is garbage. If we are gonna pay 63$ a month of something we can at least get the proper grading system included.,1
3695,great learning experience,4
3696,"Very good material and structure overall, overall meets my expectations!",5
3697,Need a discussion forum.,4
3698,"The course is well-structured, simple to understand and gives a good introduction into Arduino world.",5
3699,Very good fundamentals of C programing and simple method so eveyone can undestand.,5
3700,Good introduction of the subject,5
3701,"Amazing course, gives your a good introduction to arduino platform and C programming",4
3702,having to wait for course work to grade is tedious... it took almost a week to review three submissions,5
3703,Very good for beginners !,5
3704,I learn lot from this course about arduino and the course structure awesome.,4
3705,Good for understanding the basic of an Arduino,4
3706,It gives you all the necessary details regarding Arduino.,4
3707,Great Course! Needed to understand the basics for coding on the Arduino as well as what goes on within the Arduino. Terrific source of information. A bit slow and boring near the end but informative all the same.,5
3708,"Very good introduction to arduino programming and the platform in general. However i expected it to be a more in depth course, however i would recommended it to anyone who just bought an arduino for the first time.",4
3709,Prof. Harris does an excellent job of explaining the concepts of programming.,5
3710,Great,5
3711,"it is very useful for the starters, the concepts are very clear and understandable.",5
3712,It is a very a nice course from my point of view. Teaching standard is good and the way classes have been distinguished become helpful to learn the core concept behind the Arduino.,4
3713,"Good Class, had fun!",5
3714,"This course will open a lot of doors, new skills and a new oportunity.",5
3715,Good introduction to the topic for beginners,4

3723,Very good course who want to learn the arduino...,5
3724,Generally a good course about the very basics of hardware. It also has a nice introduction to the very basics of C Programming.,3
3725,"Great course,great instructor. It could benefit from a discussion board.",5
3726,It briefly gives us informations in detail as well as basic of course modules. It's helpful to understand about Arduino and C programming.,5
3727,"I'm auditing this series and decided to use the autodesk simulator, highly recommended tool. Overall this class is a practical hands on approach to the subject matter. Enjoyed the presentation and topics.",4
3728,Very informative and interactive.,5
3729,Best Course with good assignments and quizzes.,5
3730,It is suitable for beginer who want to use Arduino and C,5
3731,Great Course!,5
3732,i need Chinese caption,5
3733,"this is really good for beginners, but you need to learn a few things before getting into this.",5
3734,Interesting and usefull Course,5
3735,It is Amazing (Y),5
3736,The was a great course! The professor does an excellent job presenting the information!,5
3737,"Basic, ideal for begginers",5
3738,good concept to understand what is happen,5
3739,"It was a good course, I wished more courses about Arduino and examples of what we can do with the platform in real life applications. Arduino seems more accessible that raspberry pi, in terms of price (I believe I cannot complete the course about this particular platform), the software (myself I have trouble with Linux, perhaps due to my low level of knowledge), in Arduino I used mostly the 123d simulator, which helped me a lot. I am grateful to Prof. Harris, the Coursera team and the California University.",4
3740,"it was great , and its teacher was greater :)",5
3741,Very enthousiastic teacher and very clear instructions,4
3742,Very good series of courses that guides step by step in learning to use ARDUINO.,5
3743,awsome sir,5
3744,"This is a good introduction course. But!But, I don't think it's worth to pay 61 dollar for a couple of hours of lectures, that you can finish during 1 day.I'm really disappointed with the fact, that it's not possible to go through quizes and assignments without payment. What if I can't pay right now, but will be able to pay at the end to receive my certificate? I should go through the course again and I will be late for all assignments, so will have to wait for another course session... Very-very inconvenient.And, yep, coursera reduce the effect of learning with not providing quizes for those who are auditing only.",3
3745,Startinng it now,1
3746,Great Course! I learned a lot!,5
3747,very nice tutorial on Arduino programming for beginners like me.,4
3748,The course is good but little bit theoretical for science that should be 80% practical .,4
3749,Arduino is surprisingly powerful :-),5
3750,"explanation is nice ,.it will be help full if practical implementation is shown using videos",4
3751,Found it helpful.,4
3752,Explained Serial Communication very well.,5
3753,Good introductory courseThis course explains the basics of Arduino and explains C programming which is essential for Arduino sketches.This course motivated me in further learning about the Arduino.,4
3754,"Very Good lessons, great for understanding all the concepts and inpire you tu go deep to resolve the assignements. Great course!!!",4
3755,Excellent professor! Explains complicated concepts in simple and understandable terms. I look forward to completing more courses with him.,5
3756,"A quick short course to get familiar with the hardware and very basic concepts of embedded systems like debugging, UART and serial communication.",4
3757,Nice introduction about arduino and its components,5
3758,Nice basic course,5
3759,good course,5
3760,Basic progamimg understanding / interacting with Arduino,3
3761,GOOD place to start THe arduino intro is good but little short on c but its only 4 weeks not enough for me to grasp right off the bat anyway so i back off to next session then catch up more C then finish its only a couple short c videos then your asked to write programs with little or no knowledge basicly 3- 7 min lectures on the language EASY TO BE KINDA LOST AT FIRST IM 60 yrs old not twenty !!! From what im reading online LIBRARIES ARE TOTALLY LIMITED ON ARDUINOS IDE nd ITS NOT REALLY C its ARDUINO C because a lot of the workings of the arduino ide are easier for new people alot of the inner workings are hidden tough to learn the inner workings unlike a full featured IDE GOOD Platform to start on AFTER BASICS HERE with tidbits Id rather go later to C++ and spend the time there then get on better platform ARM PIC boards with real ides and REAL C + something you can use in the real world for bigger programs and I can see staying here at arduino too long and not going on to other platforms could cause bad programing habits to start with writing limited code just seems more productive after you get your electronics down coding and some hardwhare experience to go right to the real deal Pic arm or any of the other boards with a MUCH steeper learning curve GREAT to Figure out and learn electronics get some hardwhare experience here of course on ARDUINO and from what im seeing from some pros Even if there on more advanced platforms that run bigger faster programs dont have the bootloader many pros use arduino for a first layout to test circuits here first GOOD COURSE gets you DIGGING AND THINKING This is where to start you certainly cant start on advanced platforms right off its really almost impossible without a lot more skill to obtain first,5
3762,"Very good course, it goes from basic concepts to arduino programming itself, without taking too long on what is not 100% necessary. As an Electrical Engineer and an Electronics Technician my self, I saw almost 10 years of concepts I learned in those courses to be just briefly touched and got the necessary information to go ahead. It made Arduino trully accessible to anyone!",5
3763,"Basic introduction. Useful, but could use some more complexity.",4
3764,Very interesting course!,5
3765,The professor seems pretty nice and the class is great but even quizzes/answers and assignments are only available for payment,3
3766,"Very nice code. Teaches you the basics of Arduino. You may need to know C programming language, if you don't know you can learn it.",4
3767,good course for beginners and the instructor teaching simply way talent,5
3768,"I like this Course so much,In this course nothing is prerequisite,Instructor is very good he expains every things very nicely.I thinks all the student can do this course.",5
3769,"The lecturer and structure were very good. Five Stars.Sadly, I felt the course could have used a bit more substance. Less than hour of lectures per week and only one programming assignment left me wanting more. By contrast after taking https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab/home/welcome I realy felt like I had a grasp on the material.",4
3770,"Great way of learning Arduino, and a great way of providing info. by video lectures. The best part being the questions that are asked in between the lectures and that makes it more interactive virtually. The course content is no doubt enjoyable and its worth taking this course as it builds up our basic concepts of embedded systems.",5
3771,Very good introduction to Arduino Platform,5
3772,Very good and interesting to learn.,5
3773,Prefer more challenging course on this topic.,3
3774,Great course !,4
3775,This course ignited my passion for embedded systems. The Prof. made it look so easy. It helped me incorporate Arduinos to one of the Hardware modules that I teach. Thank you very much i hope my 'arduino fire' keeps burning.,5
3776,"The course is well structured and the lectures are very good. However, It could use about 2 more modules that go into more detail about c programming in arduino.",4
3777,A very good course to teach you the basics of Arduino platform and IDE. It'll help you get started on how to code your programs and lets you build up on it. I'd definitely recommend for a beginner.,5
3778,"It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer. Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough.Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit. Some problems and applications above and beyond the starter kit's intro guide would be nice and appropriate for the course. Additionally, given that this is also supposed to be an intro to C, a bit more detail and some programmatic problem solving in C would have also added good value to the course.",3
3779,"Good programme for beginners, very resourceful.",4
3780,Linking programming language to hardware sucks. Do not waste time on this course.,1
3781,Great course for those who start with C Programming with Arduino. Liked it a lot.,5
3782,A very good course. It does not teach you everything about C programming but does a very good job of teaching the bare minimum required to understand and implement simple C programs.The Arduino Platform is very well explained.,4
3783,Needs more than 4 weeks worth of material. Assignments and quizzes should be free.,4
3784,Very educational and very good teacher!,5
3785,A must for Arduino hobbist.,5
3786,Good introductory course.,4
3787,Even though very basic ... but great content & great instructor,5
3788,really good introduction course to the Arduino platform,4
3789,short lectures and perfect instructor....very nice course....you will love the instructor right away!!,5
3790,"Very basic overview of the Arduino system. Was expecting to be a bit more comprehensive. However, the final module is worthwhile, even if you know a little arduino programming.This course is baby steps to Arduino programming.",3
3791,"Great course, so much fun!!",4
3792,Great class and great professor!,5
3793,Good intro but too simple.,4
3794,"I just can repeat myself, one who is coming from non-IT area, can easily understand these lessons. Cannot wait for the following one!",5
3795,"This is a good course, especially for beginners as one can learn the basics without spending too much time or getting confused by too many technical terms.",4
3796,"Nice course, with relevant content.",5
3797,"im getting an overall idea about the arduino in this course, it covers a detailed course about its hardware too !!",5
3798,"Great beginner course for Arduino. People that are experienced with programming will probably end up zipping through some of the videos pretty fast or skipping some of them because the programming is very basic, that aside I found the lessons very interesting and would recommend them for anyone new to Arduino or wanting a refresher",5
3799,this course has a very good contentvery good instructorand increased my experience a lot,5
3800,Nice course for beginners!,4
3801,"Great Course for the beginner. I you want to get started with Arduino take this course, very helpful to understand the basics",5
3802,overall a good course. Teaches you the basics of arduino and how to integrate c language with the arduino,4
3803,More detailed insight of topics is required is what I felt. On the whole a great resource to the student community who want to start their microcontroller exploration through Arduino.,3
3804,these course is excellent for beginers!,5
3805,easy to understand.,5
3806,I'm doing this course and I'm very excited until now!,5
3807,Wonderful I'm getting further in the mastery of the IOT knowledge for my future ideas.,4
3808,Great Course,5
3809,It covers all the programming basics that are required for the setup of ARDUINO setup.Very helpful.,4
3810,"Good , but not very detailed for programming the Arduino",3
3811,Really useful,5
3812,Very good for people new to programing.,4
3813,Clear and well explained.,5
3814,Very good prof,5
3815,If I am auditing this class why can't the quizzes be free also?What happened to free Coursera?,1
3816,Excellent. Very interesting. I am playing a lot with my Arduino and learning new things.,5
3817,"Great course, great delivery style from the Lecturer. Moves along at a good, but not excessive pace.",5

3823,"Great course , learned a lot from it.",5
3824,"nice course, good for begineers",5
3825,Excellent and we'll taught,4
3826,"The interface of the classes is too straight, not very flexible. It almost looks like a real classroom, which isn't good in case we're at home learning by ourselves. Still, it has a very good content.",3
3827,Well organised.Good Clarity of Concepts. Thank you Professor.,5
3828,very useful for mechanical engineers,5
3829,I like this course a lot.,5
3830,awesome course... but some more program and there implementation should be provided,4
3831,Good introductiong for inexperient users.,4

3833,Good start up course,5
3834,good course,5
3835,Enjoyed the projects and the push to use arduino,5
3836,very good fully of information course,5
3837,"The professor way of teaching is lucid, takes thing from bottom to top in a very effective manner.",5
3838,"The course is useful ,teaches about different types of debugging but lacks examples of these systems.Good intro the the arduino.Thanks a lot.",4
3839,"A nice introduction to C programming, which could seem intimidating to non programmers at first, but this course keeps a fresh and clear perspective and you'll learn the most useful coding structures and functions to start experimenting with arduino in no time.",5
3840,"Very good introduction to Arduino and C. Easy to follow, short videos and good practical exercises.",5
3841,Great course.,5
3842,Good but a lot of technical parts all though they are discounted as not needed to know!,4
3843,"Not a bad introduction, but if you already know a bit about programming you can get the same basics and learn more quickly with a book.",2
3844,Great,5
3845,Another great series.,5
3846,This was one of my favorite courses I've even taken with Coursera. The instructor was very good at explaining the subject to a beginner like me who has some programming experience yet none with Arduino.,5
3847,"Great course, awesome professor, I wish it would include more wiring and actual projects in the making, just to get the bigger picture.",4
3848,"Prof. Harris continues to make everything crystal clear. The forums don't behave as I think they ought, but I assume that's a Coursera wide issue, and not particularly to do with this class. This course is really wonderful and I appreciate so much the opportunity to be a part of it. I have posted about it on my geek pages, and also on facebook. Thank you Prof. Harris and UCI!",5
3849,This great course and greate insturactor,3
3850,"Thanks , Prof Ian & thanks ,Ian.",5
3851,Awesome class! Recommend everyone take it.,5
3852,Should contain more workload,5
3853,not a great amount of content,3
3854,"great course!, thanks :)",5
3855,It was good but according to me it had a paucity of arduino programming for which i enrolled . However it was still helpful and i enjoyed it .,3
3856,"Some of the discussion of C programming was a little incoherent and occasionally wrong (but not in ways that would affect what you learn about Arduino programming) but otherwise the course was a blast, and it got me very interested in taking more IoT classes. Professor Harris's enthusiasm for the material comes through very clearly. I definitely recommend it.",5
3857,Very basic and good course for,5
3858,This is fantastic course.,5
3859,The course is almost about nothing. It seems to me that the teacher didn't make enough preparations and make a lot of mistakes during the couse. After 8 weeks of Arduino-related courses I've got almost nothing new besides first 2 chapters of Arduino Starter Kit book.,1
3860,very informative with simple and easy to understand explanations.,5

3891,"I felt like the C Programming parts were a bit too fast, specially the enviroment setup. But I loved this course! Congratulations and thank you!",4
3892,Prof Harris does an excellent job in this Arduino introductory class. I had a rough understanding of how Arduino worked coming into the class and was hoping for something that could fill in the gaps in my understanding. This class was excellent for my purposes but will also serve students seeking to get started with Arduino as well.,5
3893,Very interesting and well build up .Some of the C & C++ IDE software didn't properly work well on my laptop and are hard to get them going....THX Prof Ian Harris,5
3894,best course best teacher,5
3895,All the concepts were very clear and helped me a lot .,5
3896,"The teacher is really didactic and the material is good, but the course is too basic. It could be completed in a weekend. Maybe all this course could be only a Module.",4
3897,Very useful for amateur learners. Thank a lot University of California!!,4
3898,Really good and useful...,5
3899,good as a start,3
3900,Excellent Professor. Great pace and content,5
3901,"Nice course for beginners, I actually enjoyed it. Just same remark as for previous one - please review text of subtitles, it's really awful and I guess it's even funny for native english speakers",4
3902,"Excellent information and presentation, easy to understand, and relevant to both Arduino and other C/C++ microcontrollers. Great course!",5
3903,method of teaching is fantasticmore programming example may be added,5

3912,Great,5
3913,"Very good professor, good course for a start.",4
3914,"No forum, what are you thinking!",1
3915,top,5
3916,that good!,4
3917,"On one hand - basics. On the other, you may be lost in the last part of the course. You don't need to understand to complete assigements, but netherless - it's hard to understand if you do not have experience in embedded systems topic",3
3918,"Excellent teaching, very useful. I was looking for something new in my field, though arduino is bit old, still it is fascinating.",5
3919,Great course! Im trying to keep aways learning about technology,5
3920,Awesome course for someone looking beginners information about Arduino.,5
3921,A good start in the world of Arduino.,4
3922,The very basics. Overall good.,4
3923,Great introduction to the programming side of Arduino!,5
3924,Good course,5
3925,from start with the arduino it´s very good,5
3926,Easy going introduction to the topic.,4
3927,"As I was taking this class, I often wondered who the target audience was. Although the class has no listed prerequisites, I noticed a lot of engineering jargon being used without ever defining what it meant. I'm not sure that non-technical people would get much out of the lectures. On the other hand, the lectures were mostly at a superficial level, so I'm not sure that technical people would get much out of them either. The only topic that got a (somewhat) deep dive was serial communication, and it wasn't clear why; users of the Arduino don't need to understand it any more or less than any other aspect of how an Arduino works.There were other issues. The programs we wrote had to be pasted into a submission form that removed all the carriage returns when you hit Save; I had to manually fix my program each time. Perhaps most frustratingly, you could follow the assignment instructions to the letter, but after you submitted you might find out that the grading criteria included other requirements. In one case people asked about it, and it turned out that the grading criteria were wrong, but they were never updated. My sense was that not much effort went into the creation of this course.",3
3928,love the course,5
3929,Great for beginners wanting to learn how to use Arduino!,5
3930,Interesting but should be more challenging,4
3931,"I really enjoyed the class. I new a little about Arduino already, but this taught me a few new functions, and gave me an introduction (""hello world!"" style introduction) to C programming. Good stuff, I can't wait to take the next course(s).",5
3932,To professor Ian Harris and Coursera thanks alot,5
3933,Thoroughly enjoyed it. Prof Harris delivers great lectures. Looking forward to the next part.,5
3934,"Very useful course for beginners who want to start learning embedded systems. This intro course to arduino is 'THE' place to start your embedded learning. Professor Harris is great, he explained everything in detail, maintained the clarity while explaining the concepts and kept it simple, just introduced to what we need to know to get started. Thanks to Dr. Harris and UC Irvine for offering such a great course for free, it was really useful for me. I highly recommend this course for beginners.",5

3938,Bit advanced lessons would have helped the expertise in this field.,5
3939,Great...job...Really heplful..,4
3940,It is an easy to follow but very basic course. It might be good for a newbie but I expected a little more.,4
3941,I found this to be very useful in getting started with both C and the Arduino - neither of which I've studied/used before. I felt the lectures were well delivered and the videos of the Arduino board and circuit helped me to connect components correctly. I suspect some of the problems I experienced in submitting my projects might be resolved through some more detailed advice within the course notes. I'm looking forward very much to the companion course involving interfacing with the Arduino.,4
3942,"A very good course for the beginer of Arduino. After finish this course, you will feel that you are standing at the starting line of the Arduino journey.",4

3947,Great start to arduino programming.,5
3948,Great Course !!!!,5
3949,This course is too short and have little real time example .,1
3950,"This course barely touches C programming. While explanatory about the Arduino functions and structure, It should have been spread into more weeks so that it could cover more.",2
3951,Really helpful in understanding the basics of Arduino and UART communication protocols!,5
3952,Professor Ian G Harris is the kind of professor I wish i had at my university.,5
3953,It's being a clear and objective course. Well explained and nicely taught!,5

3983,A very detailed and comprehensive course.,5
3984,Excellent course with a fitting mix of challenges and material!,5
3985,Wonderful course!,5
3986,Loved the course!,5
3987,learned a lot about the subject under the guidance of Professor Meyer that's otherwise hard to study independently,5
3988,"I very much liked the course, it has a good pace and the Professor, Susan Sauvé Meyer, does a great job in presenting the material. As the course goes on material discussed before is revisited, there are running examples (so to speak) and the set up generally seems to have been well planned and constructed in advance. This is a course anyone can follow casually on the side, its fun and offers a lot. Thank you",5
3989,Excellent introduction to Aristotle.,5
3990,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course! I started with practically no knowledge on the subject, and finished with a great understanding. The course was not difficult to follow; had interesting and easy to understand lectures, and provided brilliant resources for background study. I highly recommend this course for anybody interested in Philosophy!",5
3991,Great class!,5
3992,This course gives an excellent tour of the thought of Aristotle and his successors. The course focuses on the main points of Aristotle's thought and gives the student an excellent frame work for understanding Aristotle's thought without getting lost in the details. A better course that leaves the student capable of going off and reading Aristotle on their own would be hard to produce. Great job.,5
3993,"Though not too inclusive, it's a great course for introduction.",4
3994,Absolutely wonderful! Susan Meyer is a fabulous teacher!,5
3995,"I loved this course, the Professor is thoughtful and insightful. It was a treat to take this course!",5

4000,Very good basic introduction to the philosophers and their ideas. Very succinct while staying true to the content!,5
4001,like it most the epicurean philosophy,4
4002,"Excellent course with precious insights in the works of Aristotle, Epicurus and the stoics.",5
4003,"A good follow- up to the previous course. The material is well organised and gives a profound overview while still inciting further investigation, leaving enough room for expansion of the mind and new thoughts on... almost everything.",4
4004,Excellent course for beginners. Thanks to Prof. Susan Sauvé Meyer and the Coursera staff.,5
4005,"I would like to thank the University faculty, especially professor Susan Meyer, for the excellent lessons offered to participants. I have learned a lot about Aristotle and the following schools. The video lessons contained a wealth of information on the subject. The participants also proved very interested in sharing their views and discussing some of the intriguing topics raised by the professor and by other participants. The course was truly outstanding.",5
4006,I got more out of it than I had expected.,5
4007,Beside the annoying loud music in the intro of each video it is Insightful.,4
4008,Another fine MOOC by the prof. I really like her dry delivery style.,4
4009,Professor Meyer gave exemplary lectures while explaining a variety of different philosophical schools. I found the course interesting and enriching primarily due to the high quality of the lectures given by Professor Meyer. The questions during the lectures were helpful and the quizzes were short and effective in testing learning. May Professor Meyer live long and continue to teach!,5
4010,great course ( part e of 2),5
4011,A good starting point to ancient philosophy .,4
4012,Very much enjoyed this course. Some areas were a review but in others I was able to gain a great deal of new insight into the philosophies that were covered. Many Thanks!,5
4013,"Though I feel it a bit hard, but it's still interesting.",5
4014,I like the quiz between subjects in every video courses. It is really interesting.,5
4015,I don't need the teacher to read Aristotle for me. Reading is not Teaching.,1
4016,"The gold of Aristotle's classic has been expertly mined out and presented in a connoisseur way for the appreciation, which give this lecture its form, or in Aristotle's term, its soul to be alive.Professor Meyer rarely smiled, but when she did, she smiled very charmingly. ; )",5
4017,This is an interesting and enjoyable course of well connected study units.,5
4018,An enlightening course,5
4019,Interesting overview. Would have appreciated more time on Hellenistic Philosophy,4
4020,Meyer is a great teacher and I look forward to more courses by her if she continues to release them,5
4021,This is a great course because the great instructor shares her knowledge about Aristotle and his successors in a comprehensible and exciting manner.,5
4022,"A fantastic course, simple, high-level and didactic, rare thing to see. congratulations!",5
4023,Short and sweat course!,5
4024,"Outstanding course for those who don't fear the important questions, such as: ""What makes a good life?"". Don't miss it!",5
4025,"Introductory course, but nontheless it offers deep insights and explanations of some special problems in Aristotle, Epicureanism and Stoicism. Thank you!",5
4026,more than great!!!,5
4027,The combination of this and the related Plato course are excellent.,5
4028,Good course well presented and interesting.,5
4029,This is one of my top three favorite courses I've taken on Coursera so far!,5
4030,"Both of the Ancient Philosophy courses, Plato and His Predecessors, and Aristotle and His Successors were excellent. Susan is a very good lecturer, clear, and precise.I have completed 'Introduction to Philosophy' and the 'Philosophy of Science', both at the University of Edinburgh, and can highly recommend Susan's courses at University of Pennsylvania as the next step.",5
4031,Clearly presented.course which focuses only on the principal question and themes of each of the 4 philosophies. I found it extremely valuable as it structured in a logical way these issues and also related themt modern life. My only criticism relates to the grading method of the final assignment 0 or 1 is far too simplistic.,4
4032,An excellent start to get knowledge about the philosophy principle of the ancient thinkers. Their vision have influenced the way of thinking in European and Western culture.,5
4033,"I am a mathematician, who is interested in learning and developing philosophical ideas concerning the origin of modern science. I am periodically taking philosophical courses here and there to be clear about basic notions of classical philosophical thought. I have never met such a strong qualified lecturer as Professor Susan Sauvé Meyer before. She managed to present the whole body of Aristotelian philosophy in a catchy scheme without any loss of his points. Her explanations are precise and clear. I am admired of her lectures and going to take as many of her courses as I can find.",5
4034,Great course. Thanks so much.,5
4035,This course give us a particular synthetical view of ancient thought with a particular conciseness and precision.,5
4036,Formatted like the the preceding course. This one goes in depth with the later philosophers. The lectures are very detailed and in-video quizzes are engaging.,5
4037,Very good professor. She explains everything clearly and is really enthusiastic about the topic.,5
4038,Really like the mix of theory and practical application,4
4039,"This class gets very math and theory heavy, so I would not recommend it for those looking for programming practice with the algorithms/programming approaches presented in this class. If you want thorough theoretical background information, this class would be a better fit.The use of RNA secondary structure alignment as an example of dynamic programming implementation is overkill. There are much simpler ways to introduce dynamic programming.",3
4040,"This is a challenging course that teaches an invaluable problem solving approach, applicable in many domains.",5
4041,"Great course, problem solving oriented",5
4042,The last awesome course on computing science.,5
4043,You cannot get easy answers for homework and it pushes you to think hard.,5
4044,"great, but really difficult for people with poor reading and writing skill to finish.",5
4045,"I took all 5 previous courses in this series and they were all great.But suddenly Coursera has changed its policy, and one can not take courses for free anymore.If you just want to learn and gain knowledge without chasing the certificate, than the course is useless, because you can't receive feedback for your work.",1
4046,"Super good, challenging course that forces you to think.",5
4047,Love it.,5
4048,Thank you for giving me excellent information on digital manufacturing. It is very helpful course for me. Thank you The State University of New York and Coursera.,5
4049,Good coverage of multiple topics.Very basic level overview,4

4074,Great class!,5
4075,"Nice videos, competent explanation, critical approach.",5
4076,"This course has amazing information in the lectures, but it is difficult in the video lectures to pick out what bits of information are going to be relevant in the quizzes, you will have to re-take quizzes a number of times, no matter how well you are taking notes. Also the very last section is entirely made of a rushed-maths lesson, and a quiz based on that rushed maths lesson that is VERY difficult. I would highly recommend this for anyone who already knows basic Astronomy Math, and caution anyone who doesn't.",3
4077,Excelent and nice course. Congratulations. I learned a lot,5
4078,"Loved the course videos and lectures were entertaining. I was a bit dissappointed with the outright dismissal of non-traditional understnadings of these ancient monuments and thought the explanations on why and how they were built, were lightly treated.A great course ...",4
4079,"I loved this course! This content was fascinating and the presentation was excellent, very visual which is wonderfully engaging. I'd love to see more courses perhaps",5
4080,An interesting course both from astronomical and architectural point of view. For me as an architect and amateur astronomer it was a pleasure watching the lectures in this course and learning some new interesting facts about ancient architects-astronomers.,5
4081,A very good introductory course.,5

4149,Very well done and very easy to follow. I have learned original ideas that can not wait to use it.,5
4150,Loved it!,5
4151,"A very engaging course... Many, many practical ideas which will be useful in my art room.",5
4152,"I thought this course would teach art appreciation,but seems geared towards Teachers.",1
4153,very interesting,5
4154,"Very informative video sessions, enjoyed the process and study of the course",4
4155,The teachers there do not do what they teach: they rattle down their text as fast as they can speak and do not emphasize the content with movement or even change of expression. I was disappointed.,1
4156,"I found the presentations to be very clear and focused. In addition, the readings were a good introduction to the foundation and current thinking in the field.I was disappointed in the difficulty in connecting with other students. That would have enhanced the learning experience for me. I am new to Coursera, and understand thismay be a difficult aspect of the programs to control, but it's worth a try.",4
4157,Videos were informative and I enjoyed doing the strategies with the videos.,5
4158,Interesting approach for teachers and those involved in any type of learning processes. Useful reading material,4
4159,I really enjoy this course!,5
4160,Very instructive and fun.The team know their work and they are a great help for teachers.,4
4161,nice teacher，I feel i am more interested in museum activity,5
4162,"I really enjoyed this online course)I gained a lot of knowledge, which I can apply in teaching sphere and other fields.Thank you very much to Coursera and MoMA Team! :-)",5
4163,"The course is brief, but informative. Lots of wonderful, creative ideas for educators in general--not just for art educators.",5
4164,Very instructive and many tips to enhance the student's interest for Art,5
4165,"The course was excellent, just perfect in every way, thank you very much!!! I've learnt a lot, every information, tip and technique you shared with us was just what I wanted to learn about. Thank you thank you!",5
4166,Loved it!,5
4167,Great,5
4168,"Lacking in content. The OOP portion of the final project was poorly constructed. The instructions were unclear and the exercise seemed futile. We took a data set and further complicated it by abstracting into various object classes. I think a better example could be used. Since there are already plenty of ways to do the things our objects were tasked with it seemed like a futile exercise. I think a different type of real world object should be used, perhaps one that is not easily stored in a data frame.",2
4169,"This courses touches many interesing aspects about R programming but I did not like the structure , it does not seem to me that it adequates its difficulty coming from ""The R programming enviornment"".Also I miss some swirl lessons for many of the readings from the book. There are not too many help from the mentors and the peer assigment in week 4 took me too much time and had to consult a lot of external resources. Readings in general are OK but too simple.I have learnt many things but",2
4170,More information material will be helpful,5
4171,Great course. Learned a lot about R programming in practical terms.,5
4172,"Very good, recommended.",5
4173,WIsh there were more assignments. The final project was the only assignment in the course. Object-oriented programming in R requires more than a single assignment to grasp- even at a superficial level.,3
4174,"To complete this course you have to go back and forth for the basic. Also the final assignment is bit ambiguous, more clarity is required.",3
4175,Fantastic One..!,5
4176,Amazing course. Smooth learning experience yet with increasing difficulty. Challenging and addictive.,5
4177,The first three weeks assigments were way too easy and the answers could be found in the material.The last assignment was very poorly described and the material was very limited in explaining OOP. That meant it took a lot of time figuring out what exactly was needed to complete the assignment and how to do it.Disappointing after a great first course. Hoping the next will be better.,1
4178,Great course material with engaging assignments. Strongly recommended.,5
4179,For me the course provided a quick and easy introduction to the 'purr' package as well as clarity on the current state of R's object oriented programming system.,5
4180,"the last peer review problem is much too hard for what I learned from the course material, if there is a more specific instruction for the assignment will be better.",4
4181,The course has given me good insight into the functional and object oriented programming parts of R.,5
4182,Good Course! But focus should be more on OOPs Concepts through video lectures to better understand it.,4
4183,"This course has a very clear goal. However, the implementation of this goal needs significant improvement. The first three modules were very easy to master. However, the last module was disproportionately difficult, making it unreasonable for learners.",3
4184,"Great acceleration of the specialization compared to the first course. It covers modern approaches (as map-reduce-filter implementation in purrr), nicely explains debugging, benchmarking, OOP etc. I would recommend this as a kick starter for more advanced R programming.",4
4185,"I learnt about myself skils, how to identify and how to improve as well.",5
4186,I find this course much rewarding,5
4187,'Being a Teacher' enabled me to extend my thinking to accelerate my teaching and learning abilities and creating conditions which encourage learners to want to learn.,5
4188,Well structured and easy for one with no teaching experience to flow with. Kudos for the job well delivered.,4
4189,"Really liked this course it gave me so much to learn, improve and development. One of the best course for teachers. And I would like to thanks the professors of this course. THANK YOU!",5
4190,An opportunity to continue to reflect on one's teaching within an engaging and compelling framework.,4
4191,Very important course to those who want to improve their teaching skills.,5
4192,"This course have good teachers and material. The articles of peers which you should read and assess are very Interesting, deep and curious.",4
4193,An awesome course,5
4194,"The ideas are good, but I dislike the presentation. It's hard to read the screen and quotes when they're only on the screen for a few moments. Lengthy lists are presented, however, I need to pause the video if I want to know anything that's on the list beyond the first two points. These are often the only points explained. If one is only concerned with the spoken word, then you'll gather an okay amount of information.",3
4195,Interesting material with local perspective. Could relate as an ex South African. I always looked forward to hearing the next lecture.,5
4196,This course helped me explore what being a teacher really is and how to discover my philosophy of teaching.,5
4197,This is enlightening!,5
4198,It was great to know what exactly is being a teacher.,5
4199,"I have great respect for the lessons I am learning because many times we face challenges within the classroom and we always think that we must have the answers but I was humbled to realize that my very students who create these problems have the solutions.Dr. Francis was born to be a teacher, he shares these lectures with such joy that one can only be humbles to sit at his feet and drink in the wealth of knowledge he shares with us, only for you to want to rush to your classroom and be an agent of change.These lessons are for every parent and every teacher so that we can help our very own children and students under our care as well.Happy learning everyone.",5
4200,The Commonwealth Education Trust provides you of a diverse approach to the teaching and learning issues with a global perspective over the studies and development concerning the matter. The course in particular touches a lot of interesting and important aspects to pay attention during the learning processes that may take place in institutions and relationships within these.,4
4201,"So far, very interesting course. Love the format, discussion forums and materials related to being a Teacher.",5
4202,Challenge but very worthwhile to refocus on what creates a good learning environment.,5
4203,I have really enjoyed this course.Many twwhanks to Prof John and Dr. Dennis for their inputs,4
4204,The course is to feel the difference after getting through the course.,5
4205,THE AUDIO QUALITY IS NOT CLEAR BUT CONTENTS ARE VERY USEFUL.,4
4206,Really great course! Really delves into the methodology behind effective teaching in a global classroom.,5
4207,"The things I have learnt from this course so far have been amazing, and I am keen on finishing the entire set! Thank you so much for making this course readily available to anyone with an internet connection. I am so grateful to be able to improve myself and am looking forwards to continuing my education.",5
4208,"Great as an introduction for many things but, unfortunately, it is not possible to keep on developing the themes presented on the lectures because there is no access to the sources used. Without a functional bibliography for the course, the full potential for learning of those enroled is tragically cut.",3
4209,"I needed these introductory guides to help me assess my own intentions, strengths, weaknesses in a more structured way. I have enjoyed the whole series. Only one technical issue: sound quality could always be better.",4
4210,Great!,5
4211,"Waste of time and I did not learn anything from this course.It is basically 6 weeks of the ""facilitator"" asking questions without offering much in the form of answers.",1
4212,Great Course!,5
4213,i'm enjoying the courses in this spcialzation and i'm working toward a goal to complete each course to earn the final certicate in the teaching for learning specialization .,5
4214,"Such lame quizes, I cannot pass them although I know this material in my sleep,because the english is so bad and has so many ambiguities; There are no single answers to a question, instead you need the check the correct answers, which are phrased in s misleading way, and one little mistake fails the whole question. So I try and try and try and never get all the correct checks for the specific questions. So I just fail and retry and fail and retry. This is so frustrating I consider I will unroll this course. Same because I know all this material !!!!",1
4215,"It hard to work with Arduino, and it's harder to work with the Iskra. But the course are very useful. I like the way the teacher guide us to do the experiment. Step by step, try and fail, you will finish this course with pround.Thanks you so much!",4
4216,"Very interresting course. Step by step from scratch, very complete with good explanations and lectures and many experiences. A must have done !Thanks for the course !Best reghards,GEP",5
4217,Really great course,5
4218,I have much fun in this course!,5
4219,"More respect after the course than before, as I thought this would be a pretty easy Excel course, but finishing it called lot of real work and statistical and modelling understanding.",4
4220,Really amazing course. I enjoy it. The only thing is that videos should be more explicit and deeper in the difficult topics.,5
4221,Good for learning statistical analysis using real examples (bank credit card application) and hands on the data in the final project!,4
4222,"Fun to watch, great exercises and examples, interesting subjects made simple. Congrats!",5
4223,Very useful course.,5
4224,"I wish this course was more focused on building and analyzing data in excel. It feels like it's more focused on financial measurements and probability, it hasn't related to my line of work yet.",3
4225,"Very useful knowledge in this course. Although, some of the quizzes require some small fixes, and there are minor mistakes in some lectures.",4
4226,"Good Course, but final project asks a lot for what this course is",3
4227,"Hello, I am Gabriel Wang from TAIWAN. I am currently working as HSEQ Manager in a LNG shipping management company. Thank you for been so patient & Nice for having course online. I DO learnt a lot from it. Appreciated.",5
4228,"Leve of difficulty was above my expectations. Moved too fast. Could have been more thorough in applying the content to examples similar to the quiz. Seemed to stick to the bare minimum of what would be required before moving to the quiz. Be transparent with future prospective students that this course absolutely requires knowledge of calculus, probability, and statistics.",3
4229,"Resources provided are very good in quality, completeness, easy to understand, and clear for neophyte.",5
4230,"Good course, bit disjointed at times and some of the maths is rushed through, or not really relevant. Not sure I need proofs on why standardising figures results in easier to use data, maybe just show us how to do the analysis and apply it to more examples in real life.",4
4231,Not quite the excel actually relevant to industrial requirements. had to leave the course mid way.There are better Excel DA courses out there. Concept presentation was good though.,2
4232,I enjoyed the class even though I felt it was a little over my head. I learned a lot about the processes involved in doing this work.,5
4233,"The course was a bit disappointing. We didn't cover enough advanced Excel functionalities, opting instead to focus on 2 statistical models (Binary Classification and Linear Regression). Having a BSc in Economics, the Linear Regression tutorials and quizzes seemed infantile, while the Binary Classification tutorials proved to be too vague, when we actually had to apply this knowledge on the final project. In retrospect, I regret not starting to work on the final week's material right from the start, which resulted in having to switch session multiple times in order to finish the course. Even if I had done so, though, it wouldn't have made up for the vague instructions in the quizzes and assignment of the final week that made feel at a loss, until I asked for help in the forums. All in all, this course need some serious re-working, in terms of how the material is presented and how the assignments are phrased.",2
4234,"I´m quite disappointed in this course. First you should know that the first week doesn´t reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter. As I was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon I started the second week I was wondering what happen to the clear, concise examples and ideas presented in the first one. First The presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view. It´s BARELY READABLE ! It allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed. That could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly it´s not the case most of the time. The examples are rarely connected to something real, numbers come up from ... nowhere. The level of difficulty could be challenging if you don´t have a bachelor of sciences like Math or Physics or Bio. It´s NOT A BEGINNER COURSE.To give more context I have done and succeed more 16 courses , 2 specializations, followed/audited about 3 others courses and that is the first time I´m giving a bad review. I´m sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course , there is a lot subjects presented but I definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples. With some changes that course will fly high :)",1
4235,"Final project almost impossible to do with material taught. Also, each lecture comes with an additional spreadsheet that needs to be studied. Material taught doesn't match material tested.",2
4236,Solid class focused on the mechanics of building and evaluating binary classification models using Excel,4
4237,"The course is both tough and interesting. The interesting bit comes from developing a model for a credit card company, which is a rather creative and captivating process. The tough part is in hectic learning of a vast array of statistical terms, often poorly explained – and alost never applied to practice (it is true that some of statistical metrics are ""applied"" in quizzed but it is unclear what's their purpose besides computing yet another number).",4
4238,great course if you want to go deeper in business,5
4239,"Not very helpful for those with a solid statistical background. I prefer to use R to do the modeling things, while this course should talk more about pivot tables and existing useful financial functions which advantage over other statistical tools.",1
4240,"Great class! The teachers explained everything in detail, looking forward to takmore classes in the future!",5
4241,"A bit too academic, I would like to see explanations on Excels and business cases.",4
4242,Teaching method of Daniel is awseome,5
4243,Not enough detail and information provided in the lectures to undertake the final assessment.,1
4244,"The course is very challenging, but very interesting. I will probably suggest a bit more of staff support in the last week, specially the final project which is very challenging and demanding. A bit more of orientation will be really good.",4
4245,"Irrationally difficult and inexplicably sloppy. Having taken first ""Business Metrics for Data Driven Companies"" I had high hopes that it would be on the same level.Well, I was wrong. It was extremely messy, jumping around from definition to definition with little to no explanation and there was a general lack of motivation from professor Egger's part.Apart from week 1 that had some necessary basic knowledge of Excel, all of the next weeks' lessons were fast paced beyond a beginner's comprehension. By week 5 I had lost the motivation to go on and was only able to finish it through a great deal of trial and error on the quizzesI would not recommend it, unless you have some basic knowledge of the economic theories used in this lesson.",1
4246,It's not Excel... it's applied probability theory using Excel workbooks.,4
4247,I very much enjoyed this course. I've been able to apply some of the strategies I learned in the specialization and I look forward to using it as a resource moving forward.,5
4248,I love this course and the way the material is explained. I plan on taking this course again to improve my understanding of the information because I think it relays very important ideas.,5
4249,"An absolutely dreadful course. The only things you'll end up studying are how to use the spreadsheets given and what the instructor was thinking when creating them... I can't figure out what, and there doesn't seem to be any way of finding out. The lectures were mostly stuff I learned at school and really quite easy, but I just have no idea what the final project has got to do with the lectures.",1
4250,All theory. Quizzes you were left with the task of answering questions based on models never seen or explained spent most time trying to make sense of them. Final project is almost a joke to try and decipher how to create from scratch based on the ones they provided in the quizzes. Its not a joke but it is very difficult when the actual excel and model making isnt part of the lectures.,2
4251,Good material but short explanation and no detail exercises and solution practices before the final test makes the test a bite hard to resolve.,3
4252,very very interesting and well explained,4
4253,"Overall, the course material is good with many example. Need a general knowledge with mathematical and statistical from the beginning to pass the exam, because course slide is a little bit fast.",5
4254,Tougher than the first in the specialization. You have to spend time on the material to succeed. In the end a lot of the concepts were not that difficult to figure out - don't overthink things as well!,4
4255,Such a good course to learn about data analysis and statistics by using Excel!,5
4256,Very good course,5
4257,if you do not have a background in statistics do not expect to pass this course,1
4258,I being a beginner found this course to be very helpful.It gave me a good start in data analysis.,5
4259,Great course for applying real word scenarios with analytical tools such as Excel.,5
4260,really awesome course...,5
4261,Good Course so far. But lacks indepth explanation. Courses such as probability need to be taken prior to this,4
4262,Course is very good! All examples are very clear and detailed. And a spreadsheet is provided to follow along during class. Only bad thing is that it was not so clear this course is heavily related to Math. Data Analysis = Math & Statistics. ;-),4
4263,"Course did not meet any of the expectations. Neither Excel nor the analysis part. Should have focused on one of the aspects to make it more stronger. In my opinion ""deviated"" & stressed too much on statistics and model building (regression, logistic regression etc.) but did not do justice to that also!",2
4264,pragmatic enough and a lot of stat to be learned,5
4265,Really great! Things taught in this course are useful.,5
4266,"Though at the start of the program indicates no prerequisite I would suggest that you be familiar with Algebra and Stats. Most videos are of Dr. Egger writing out algebraic equations and discussing them, the excel component of Mastering data in excel come via pre-made calculators as attachments that you for the most part need to figure out on your own.If you do not have a good comfort level with stats then you will require more time to spend on understanding the spreadsheet and it’s use.It would be fantastic if Dr Egger could go through the spreadsheets as a part of the video and show a couple examples, hopefully revisions down the road !It was challenging but not impossible, and if you do not challenge yourself how much are you really learning?Best of luck!",3
4267,"I feel this is way too hard for people who are not good at math, or haven't studies math for a long time. Took me longer time to figure all questions out.",4
4268,Difficult as hell.When You complete it You really start understanding this area but I think due to level of difficulty teaching staff should be a little more active.Big difference in difficulty in lessons(which are easy)and test(which are sometimes incredibly difficult).If You want to work in Big Data field You HAVE TO complete this course but...expect hell.,4
4269,"really use full,but before this cousre we need to acquire some mathematical and statstical knowledge.",4
4270,The course was very clear and they included topics on information theory and statistics.,5
4271,"I read some of the other reviews and feel I should comment on some of their criticisms.The material, objectives and tuition are top-notch. Yes there are things that are unclear and difficult and I you will need to read around the subjects introduced from other sources and persevere.But that is how you will learn and remember.So far I have yet to complete the course, I am about to start my 4th attempt, but I get a little further each time and the next presentation acts as revision initially. Daniel Eggar introduces key concepts that you need to master, this course is not spoon fed, but is better for it.If I have a criticism, perhaps the course is badly named, maybe it should be called ""Core statistical concepts for data science using Excel""",5
4272,Too difficult for a beginner,4
4273,Course only drilled down on specific aspects of excel that were inclined to regression analysis which is just one aspect used in business analysis,3
4274,Excellent Course!! Great insight on binary classification model !! I recommend this course to anyone who is looking to master data analysis skills using Excel.,5
4275,"I'm here learning Excel skills, but this course, especially week 2, does not teach Excel skills.",2
4276,Very practical course! Learned a lot.,5
4277,Excellent Faculty and robust coverage!!,5
4278,Egger is very well instructor. The course is useful.,5
4279,I work with excel and thousands of lines of data everyday. I found this class to be challenging,4
4280,"It is best to have a strong statistical background before taking this course. Lots of statistical calculations and procedures. If you don't have a strong background in statistics , there is a good chance you will get lost at some point in the course. There is no questions that the instructor of this course is an accomplished mathematician, I just found it hard to follow his lectures as he got deeper into various statistical aspects of the course.",2
4281,"nice syllabus overall with great exercises.wish it would teach more commonly used excel skills in business e.g. pivot tables, index-match, vlookup etc.lectures were a bit hard to follow (esp the mathy ones) - i'd suggest reworking the blackboard craft",3
4282,Very hard to comprehend for 6 weeks. But could have been great.,3
4283,This is more of an introduction to statistics lesson than one in excel... not what I had signed up for,1
4284,"Not done with the course yet, but I have to say it started out very well and organized. I was actually learning how to use excel in the first week WHILE the instructor was teaching. The later weeks, however, seem to be completely different. They're disorganized and I'm struggling to see how the material correlates. It's as if I'm being bombarded with random topics, in addition to the fact that the instructor literally stops using excel to teach. After week 1, lessons are just random notes on a blackboard with a link at the end to the excel sheet in which the instructor has already prepared before with A LOT of info that you need familiarize yourself with solo. I had high hopes when I was done with the first week, but now I have to say I'm bored and demotivated!! (so far)",1
4285,"The explainations are a bit hard to follow if you are in a hurry, some times the course concepts just jump onto you. The techniques and content are really really great and very relavent, but the instructional value can be further ehnanced.",4
4286,"This course has nothing to do with Excel. It should be called ""Statistic and binary modelling with little use in excel"". If you except to learn about functions, pivot tabels, macros and the many other exciting features of excel, this is NOT the course for you.",1
4287,I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week. Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard. Sorry there are a number of times I have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand. Hence I even have to place myself in another slot because I could not finish the assignment. Please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn. Thank you.,1
4288,"This course isn't for the faint hearted, you need a decent background in statistics, intermediate mathematics and good grounding in excel. All of these are covered well in the course but there's a lot to take in and I can imagine it being quite tough for those not so familiar. That said, the topics, examples and tools provided are exactly those required to build a good foundation in Business Analytics and I imagine, Data Science. Prof. Egger as always, delivers the course with great aplomb and shares his considerable knowledge in a wise but unassuming manner. Highly recommended.",5
4289,"Very little to do with Excel, mostly focused on statistics with brief overviews of how things could be done within Excel, but very little focus on actual Excel use and knowledge.",2
4290,"This course is only supported by a course of data analytics. It should clearly state that advanced statistics is a prerequisite knowledge. I expected to learn advanced excel techniques, not to be required to know statistic models to apply.",2
4291,A great course to learn excel for analytics.,4
4292,First step toward becoming data scientist.,5
4293,Not so good. The course explains mathematical models and Excel applications but both are not detailed. There are many mistakes in PPTs and assignments.,3
4294,This is not an easy course and some concepts/tasks weren't clearly addressed.But the instructor is great!,4
4295,Getting more theoretical and less practical application on Excel application. Advanced Data interpretation and solving methods information can be included.,3
4296,The course is built around people doing/studying business and economics. I am a scientist but I still learned a lot from it. The course is very practical.,5
4297,Good Presentation,5
4298,"Though the Course name is Mastering Data Analysis in Excel. This course will take you beyond Excel mastering skills. Quite a Short Course compare to amount of Statistical and Probability concepts you learn. This course covers most of the concepts and models necessary for any Data Analyst & Data Science students and Professionals. This course is quite challenging and at times frustrating and time consuming but in the end you will feel you learnt something what you don't know. It will be worth your effort.If you don't know something what you don't know. Here is the course, it is an accelerated course. You many not master all of them, you will master some, I can assure any future students Professor will give all the information and concepts that you need to master. Even after completing the exam I keep repeating and going back to videos and notes which is really valuable.",5
4299,The second test should be compulsory for also the non-paying students!,3
4300,Indeed a Mastering course for Data Analysis!,5
4301,"The instructor should spend more time putting equations and concepts into concept, and tying them together. It often felt like values and questions were arbitrary. This is less about master data analysis in Excel, and more about gaining ground in a few key concepts, so the title is misleading as well.",3
4302,"This is not a basic excel training. The title is appropriately set as ""Mastering"" Data Analysis in Excel...",5
4303,"I did learn a few helpful tips for analyzing data with excel - particularly how to do a regression analysis in excel which is something I didn't know and is not intuitive. But for a course that is supposed to teach you how to analyze data in excel, there are actually very few lectures that actually show you how to do anything in excel. So much time is spent on how to calculate stuff by hand, without even mentioning how it translates to excel. Also the lectures have a lot of errors that were not corrected in a professional way. Just a random slide put in as an afterthought. The lectures got a bit disorganized towards the end, like the professor was in a rush and then forgot to relate everything to actual business analysis. The final project was especially difficult as not much was explained - I had to read the forums to figure out what I was actually supposed to do.",2
4304,I would like to recommend for every beginner who wants to learn data analytics!,5
4305,Awesome course to take if you want to be proficient with basic usage of Excel,5
4306,This course is very challenging. I may not have had the proper background in mathematics to full absorb the material. Similarly I may have to busy of a lifestyle to have properly focused on this class.,3
4307,We learn a lot in this course,5
4308,"It's more statistics than Excel itself, wich is good but I think the name doesn't fit to it",3
4309,inclination was more towards concept than excel,3
4310,"swollen with pride that I could be a great biz analystofcourse, with Great professors ^~^",5
4311,"This course was tough, but I dont mind a challenge. But what I found frustrating about this course was that first the quizzes were often inconsistent with the lecture material, the TA's were less helpful than my fellow classmates (without whom I would not have made it through the course) and the final was an IMMENSE challenge that took over my life for about 1 week - despite the calculation by the instructors that it would take 6-8 hours. I did give it a few stars because I honestly did learn things I did not know, and I understand the value of the application of what was taught for modern businesses. I have been informed that the course is being reviewed by the instructors for strengthening and I 100% agree with that direction.",2
4312,"Beware this course, especially if you are new to this area (despite what the course/specialization says). There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course, but what's worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos; the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos, so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments/projects satisfactorily or smoothly.I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn't paid for this specialization. Beware.",2
4313,very nice stuff.,5
4314,Title misleading. Never ever a beginners course.,1
4315,"The concepts here are useful and Mr. Egger is a knowledgeable instructor but 1) this class is really about gathering information with Excel as the tool - you aren't learning anything about Excel functionality, so the title of this course is really misleading if you just want to become a stronger user in Excel 2) there is a huge disconnect between the video lessons and the excel worksheets used to complete the assignments and since many previous reviewers mentioned this, it seems like that's not going to change. 3) the disconnect between the lessons and the assignments wouldn't be an issue if the instructor could be bothered to respond to forum questions. Mine sat unanswered for 5 days as the deadline passed. You are NOT going to get support if you dont understand something.",1
4316,Really unhappy with how difficult and over complicated it is. I came here to learn about Excel. Pivot tables? functions? The course really loses focus and its unfortunate that I am now stuck here and cannot continue the entire specialization.,1
4317,"The title is misleading .This course has a little to do with excel , you could get some mathematical information but I do not think you will master anything",2
4318,"PROS:- Classification lecture is good;-Weekly assignments are challenging enoughCONS- No slides provided. Professor draws on an eletronic chalkboard (with a very bad handwriting) and you need to keep going back to videos when you are doing the homework. For me, this shows lack of professionalism and laziness- Some excel sheets are provided. But they are very messy and badly formatted, matching the messy handwriting in the videos. AND, the instructions are for MAC! No instructions for PC are provided whatsoever. I never used MAC, so I had a very hard time!- Very few examples real examples are provided;- You learn math concepts, not Excel skills! Except for the LINEST function, which is very handy, BUT it's NOT TAUGHT in the videos. I had to google the function to learn it.- They say to complete each piece of the final assingment after you finish the respective week related to that piece. But they only say that as you start week 6!- The course doesn't provide sufficient material for the final assignment. You get stuck without knowing how to get to answers;- Some answers to the final assignment are not correct, you check the answer sheet, and the results aren't present in the test!OVERALL:I'd never recommend this course to anyone. I only took it because I'm plannening to finish the specialization.I've taken several Online Courses (5+ on Excel), and this is the worst and most frustating one by far!",2
4319,The order and content of the lessons wasn't planned with sufficient care.,3
4320,"The course is quite tough for me, but I enjoyed the topics discussed, primary between a binary model and a linear regression model. The addition of Excel into this course adds an application layer, which helps me to bring the concepts to the working world as well, and not just plain academic knowledge.",4
4321,Quiz does not require hands-on experience of creating templates but rather simply plugging in numbers. Students may forget most of the content after finishing the quiz.,3
4322,"Very poor lecture, I barely learn anything about excel from this course. The course title is quite mis-leading",1
4323,not easy but rather clear speech,4
4324,"Well, it'll be good if you set the expectation that you're learning information theory and binary classification in this course, with Excel being the tool by which you use to learn those concepts.However, do not expect this course to be entirely about Excel, it is not.With the right expectation, this is a great course!",5
4325,Great - the maths section was actually educational,5
4326,"When the instructor for the course expresses amazement at the level of difficulty people are expressing in the forums that tells you a lot about how out of touch he is with what he is teaching and what is really required prerequisite knowledge.There is minimal actual instruction in excel-most often concepts are taught much like Khan Academy, on a digital blackboard. Nothing inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word 'EXCEL' in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually demonstrate using excel. Nope, not here.If you've never heard of linear regression or Bayes Theorem don't bother with this course. Honestly. While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video won't clear the fog.You absolutely will not 'master' data analysis with this course. I've used Excel for over 15 years, daily, and to have the gall to say your course will 'master' something with a few videos is misleading and deceptive.If it wasn't for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure.If you're wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere. i.e. EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with people's impression of actually using excel in that context.Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel he's been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those who've been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs. The course in more on the level of a 201 and in certain parts 401 level but not 101.",1
4327,"Very important course if you want to know more about data analysis. Fascinating materials (Markowitz optimisation, linear regression, information gain, binary classification...) with both theoretical and practical aspects! In spite the fact you won't learn much about VBA skills, this course will definitely give you a very good basis for addressing any data analysis problem with Excel.",5
4328,Be prepared to study a lot as the material is comprehensive and vast.,4
4329,Misleading course name/title. Was expecting a course on using Excel. Forums were cluttered and not monitored often.,1
4330,Easily and fun learning for novice learners as well as non-mathematics background.,5
4331,given very useful material,5
4332,It's just not only Excel...is mostly data analysis.,4
4333,Very good course,5
4334,"Although more about Prob and Stat than learning to use Excel, concepts of binary classification and entropy are very interesting and are taught very deliberately and thoroughly. More practise quizes and worked out examples would be even better.",4
4335,It is very easy and unusefull course.,1
4336,could have lecture more.... the videos talks little about the spreadsheet provided,3
4337,It's too advanced for people with no experience in statistics and sometimes too abstract to relate with,3
4338,"Constants errors in explanations, made you work very hard to complete it. We typically work hard, the organization of this course my you to suffer. You will go to learn a lot like I do. (Final Grade 91.4%). Learn in this course can be frustrating, they will push to the water, you will need to dedicate a lot of time discuss course material with fellow learners, mentors, and instructors to learn how to swim to save your life.",2
4339,"Really wanted to take this class. Unfortunately, I believe it is more about advanced statistics then excel. It was advertised as a beginners class and that is not the case. I recommend having a significant knowledge of statistics before taking this course. I'm a 15 year senior level accounting executive and I was easily spending 10 to 15 hours a week plus watching the videos 3 or 4 times each in order to understand the content. It was very difficult to understand. Disappointing.",1
4340,Too difficult. The lessons go too fast.,2
4341,Not so comfortable with using Excel.,3
4342,very good - step by step and clear.,4
4343,I found Week 2: Binary Classification really confusing. It was just not clear. Specifics were not given. Definitions were not given. Poorly instructed.,2
4344,It was an interesting course.,3
4345,"The Course is fine, explanations and videos are a bit hard to follow at times.The final assessment is in my opinion very bad, as it i appears to me quite unrelated to the course it self. The lectures are quite abstract and the exam is a practical application of the concept.The instructions of the course also aren't very good as you need to do each part of the final project at the end of each week.I would strongly suggest to not take this course unless you have many spare hours.",3
4346,"Poorly coordinated lectures. References to resources that are not provided. No response (at least, for days on end) when questions are posted on the forums",1
4347,"quite a lot techniques to learn. Just wish they could explain more about applications of those techniques, in more details, which however might be hard to get done in 5 weeks though.",4
4348,"This is an advanced Statistics class. Learning was chaotic, confusing, and fast paced. Strong Mathematics skills required. As icing on the cake, there is an 8 hour project at the end of the course .. and they only tell you at the end that you should have been working on this all along! Not at all what I wanted to learn or find productive in the real world.",1
4349,So far i have found it useful. Most of the introduction elements are elementary but it gives you a chance to build up your knowledge and apply it as you go.,4
4350,"No relevance to specialisation. Do not expect to get through this if you have not taken multiple statistics courses at university level or higher maths. Barely any practical application, does not prepare you for final project.",1
4351,This course has a lot to do with math and statistics and I find it really hard to follow especially when it comes to the final project.,3
4352,I hope the video could show me more about how to do these entropy calculations in Excel,5
4353,highly recommend,5
4354,"Concepts are fantastic but the material developed to deliver the course is short of expectations, especially from a university. Excel sheets do not match what is demonstrated in video lectures, lots of confusion around how to complete tasks, quiz answer options not being correct, and missing Excel spreadsheets (e.g. video lecture says to refer to accompanying excel spreadsheet, but no spreadsheet available). Also, judging from past discussions by students, some inconsistencies around formulas being presented in video lectures versus assignment questions. could have been a great course, but the inconsistencies have made is very disappointing.",1
4355,"Interesting statistical concepts, and great theory. However, the lectures and the quizzes do not prepare the student well for the final project.",1
4356,Great contents and teachers!,5
4357,Really confusing and struggled a lot. The course doesn't prepare you for the final project.,1
4358,"Very heavy on the stats front, not so much on utilizing Excel but I learned some useful things in this class.",4
4359,The course doesn't prepare you for the final project.,1
4360,Easy understanding and practical.,5
4361,"The title is very misleading. Excel is an afterthought for this course; instead there is a heavy focus on statistics. The class claims to be for beginners, but that is clearly not the case, as it requires previous knowledge in inferential statistics and calculus.Excel is hardly used and is certainly not the focus; there are weeks where Excel is not used at all. There are no practice assignments, only quizzes.It's clear that this course is outdated and poorly maintained, as the videos refer to examples that are not included or content that was not presented.Needless to say, I will not be taking any other courses in this specialization.",1
4362,very nice course，discussions are very helpful.,5
4363,Good course. Wish it was more hands on working with excel.,4
4364,I found much of this material wasn't as applicable to excel analysis as hoped and didn't cover many of the analysis tools,2
4365,"Excellent content, learned many new things. Mainly new tools in Excel with the Solver.",5
4366,"It was hard to follow along with the lessons, because it was mainly present in formulas. More examples might help students relate the information better.",3
4367,"This course really tortured me , but really worth the time and effort, I did learn something by heart :)",5
4368,very helpful and useful in real case,5
4369,The course structure is not thoughtfully prepared. There is a lot of confusion around what the instructor wants to say. The practice quizzes and course content have no match whatsoever,1
4370,Really helpful,5
4371,"This quickly became a statistics course, which although important was really difficult for me as I went in not expecting it.However, Dr. Egger is incredible! I think he's a fantastic and well-versed instructor in the Data & Analytics realm and am eager to find ways I can use what I've learned into practice at work.",3
4372,Good content but badly structured,5
4373,This class required far too much independent study. The instructor did not provide enough instruction or reading material to complete the quiz each week. There was too much focus on the conceptual data with very little emphasis on practical application of the material.,2
4374,Difficulty (at least for me) was non-linear. Weeks 1-2 were very basic with weeks 3-4 moving into parts of stats that I don't recall from my college course so it took some extra work to apply the models.,4
4375,Dr Eggers is a tremendous professor. The course has wit and application along with assignments that are well scaffolded to the learning content. Highly recommend this class.,5
4376,Very interactive and simple to learn course.the video lectures are very clear to understand and worksheets are helpful to gain a better understanding of the topic.,4
4377,The class has great concept but it needs a bit more structure and change to hit its full potential.The Good:-The spreadsheets and exercises along with Quiz material. The project was also very informative.The Bad:- The video need to better explain how Area Under Curve and how the Credit model make sense. It was not very intuitive and I struggled for over 2 weeks to put the Project together due to this gap.But a worthwhile class with great potential. I am glad I took it.,3
4378,learn lots of practical things,5
4379,Not enough practices for the unexperienced students.,3
4380,The attendants might already have a good foundation of econometric and probability statistics before taking this course. Some definitions might be difficult to understand especially how it would be applied in real life.,3
4381,"Fantastic course, a lot of work. You definitely need decent maths and a bit of basic statistics to fully understand the course. The course covers many topics and provide great practice on core application in statistics field.",5
4382,"I am sorry to say this, but the tutorial could have been organzied in a much more serious way.I do not know how much time the Professors have put on preparation. But it gives me a ""sloppy"" impression!!! The class carries the name of University of Duke and 70 euros are charged, so I think the learners would reasonably expect to see that the teacher puts lots of time to organize the course structure, in order to efficiently give as much as information to the learners within limited time!For example, I believe nobody would not say that the Week 2 content on confusion matrix is very consistently explained. And this is just one example.",2
4383,Tough class but filled with useful and applicable ata analysis using the most popular and available program to do this work... Be prepared to get a little frustrated and watch the instructions more than once..... It's not Cousera fun fluff !!!,4
4384,"Content is not well organized, videos are disconnected from one another, explanations are not clear, spreadsheets contain vast information that is not explained anywhere. It is been quite difficult to follow through the course and I bet many students are giving up.",1
4385,I really recommend this course. Very useful!!Perfectly explained.,5
4386,Week 1 a little disapointing,2
4387,"Great Course, it's a useful tool to improve your excel, and your Knowledge in statistics.",5
4388,This course is doable if you have prior knowledge of probability and statistics. This is not for beginners and should therefore by reclassified as intermediate and above. I am sorry I enrolled in this course. I have truly hit a brick wall and can go no further...,2
4389,Goto course ...... very nice ....... :),5
4390,This course contains too few solid content.,2
4391,This is definitely not a course for beginners .,2
4392,"Great course, just a little too technical",4
4393,Does not teach Excel very well while tryng to apply the basic usage instruction to not too difficult problems. The ability to interface with Excel after some knowledge of Python/R or other programming languages would be helpful in the Data Science programming that is increasingly being promoted.,2
4394,"While the first week touched on Excel and the equations can be used in Excel and have efficacy in regards to analyzing data, it feels as if the course emphasizes more on utilizing math than utilizing Excel. And according to my understanding, that was what I thought I was signing up for. So, it felt like a bait-and-switch to me.",2
4395,"Way too theoretical. This is Excel, not Information Theory....",3
4396,Highly useful and practical course. it can be a bit challenging for Uni graduate from irrelevant field.the First course and the visualisation course from this series of specialisation is okay .,4
4397,To course got tougher every week while the lecture video is not cover everything.,2
4398,"this course is definitely NOT for beginners. you MUST have intermediate to advanced knowledge of statistics and math. I had to resort to google and khan academy extensively just to grasp the concepts in this course. This course also does not teach you everything about excel, let alone master it. you just refer to pre made excel sheets for quizzes. thats it. Good luck figuring those out.",1
4399,"In light of R or Python, doing statistical computing in excel is really time consuming and backward. The instruction might be OK, but I lost interest beginning of week 2 seeing how he build binary decision model in excel.",2
4400,"This is my first Coursera course and I wasn't sure what to expect. I was hoping for a good experience but preparing myself for mediocrity.I finished the course at 2am on Monday morning and I've been really impressed, both with the Coursera ""infrastructure"" and with the quality of the teaching from Daniel Egger and his team. I live in South Africa where tertiary educational standards vary widely, and appear to be on the decline. More and more, we are going to need MOOCs like this from the best universities in the world.More specifically, relating to this course, I found the video lectures well presented and the quizzes thoughtfully prepared. The Excel models really helped with grasping the concepts and practice.A couple of suggestions:a) The course FAQ makes light of the background knowledge necessary to cope with the course. It needs to be more honest about the need for mathematics and statistics. Linear regression is not for sissies, in my opinion.b) Please tell us at the START of the course that we should attack the project week by week. This advice isn't (unless I missed something) given until you open the week 6 project. Ahem... it's too late by then! I spent a very frantic 4 nights last week crunching the project work, 4 quizzes and the assignment. I got to bed at 2.30am, and i'm not a night owl.Overwhelmingly though, a really interesting course. I'm already starting the next one.",5
4401,Not exactly for business use,4
4402,Great course for learning some data analysis with excel that is also accessible even if you have had little experience in excel before.,5
4403,"Frankly speaking, this course is a little bit hard for me although I have studied them during my master programs. There are many formulas in the course and hardly to remember in short time. I had to review the videos several times. I'd like to recommend the professor may summarize such fomulas in one page so it's more easy to students to catch up the course.",5
4404,Great course. Relevant ad practical examples and case studies.,5
4405,"The importance of this course is huge. However, I did miss better explanation from some topics...",3
4406,"I find it very practical. Not only do the lectures give you general overview of the concepts with examples, but also they teach you how to do the maths which is very important in my opinions. Thank you very much Prof. Egger and the team.",5
4407,"Don't be fooled by how detailed and clear the first weeks videos are. The second thru the final weeks are lacking details and explanations and found myself lost during most of the videos. There were even a few typos and errors. Be ready to do a lot independent research and learning from other sources in order to complete the weekly quiz. I was unable to complete the final project of this course due to the lack of knowledge provided by the lecture videos and some of own research. I was hoping to complete the specialization for this, but it doesn't seem like this course provided me with enough to proceed.** The use of excel on the weekly basis was poorly integrated with the flow of the course.",1
4408,"I found this course too advanced for my level of familiarity with statistics. Its true that most basic stuff is covered to be fair, but the progression is very rapid.As I work long hours and other commitments I didn't have enough time to dedicate to study beyond the time needed just for this course. If I had been able to study an extra 10 hours a week practicing using the formulas then I'm sure I would have got more out of it.",2
4409,"I found this course to be very challenging, but I am grateful for the knowledge and the new perspective. Thanks!",4
4410,"towards end of the course, specifically linear regression week, a lot of buzzwords are strung together. I wish, the instructor would be a little bit more sparing in their usage together (together is the keyword). Eg ""This is the connection between linear regression and mutual information in a parametric model where we have gaussian distributions"" I feel that each term in isolation I know what they mean, but when strung together, I am unclear how to process the meaning.",4
4411,Instructor is highly knowledgeable and provides an interesting and thought provoking lecture.,5
4412,Simply if define it in one word. EXCELLENT!!,5
4413,"I would have appreciated a bit more of a hands-on process in building the workbooks (with proper instruction of course) and more formal presentation of the formulas being used, but overall, I got a lot out of this course and enjoyed it along the way.",4
4414,"The content of the course was good.However, I did not like the presentation of the material, moreover such a topic would need to be covered by a longer duration course.",2
4415,I really enjoyed the course. Professor was very good at explaining everything. And the team was very helpful. And this course is definitely for people who already has a good backround in exel and working with data.,4
4416,"I expected far more handy real life Excel examples, not to see a teacher speaking and writing stat formulas for hours.The idea of this course is very good, it has some room for improvement.",2
4417,"I missed some more content in certain areas of the course (i.e. histograms). Apart from that, great course and great explanations by Daniel Egger!",4
4418,"Like the course content. Though I know lot many function in Excel, but solve was new and kind a unique one.",5
4419,The training course excellent however I would like to find the quiz for the week number 1,4
4420,"This course did not live up to its potential.The course should be retitled as an ""Intro to Statistics"" not learning functions and visualizations on excel.I still have three stars because I at least picked up some useful concepts from it.",3
4421,Final project really hard,3
4422,"Excellent class. Much tougher than expected. I went in thiinking I was an Excel guru, and learned a ton.",5
4423,"Complex concepts (e.g., regression), which cannot be taught in such a short course format (I know from extensive prior training), are taught here in an arcane way. I don't know how students without prior knowledge on these topics (e.g., regression, ROC curve analysis) could possibly understand this when taught this way.Course is also in an 'early draft' mode, with plenty of mistakes in the videos/slides. The course (and specialization) really tarnishes - instead of enhancing - this institution's outside image and reputation.Really a deception; sorry I took this class and specialization, a complete waste of my time and money. The initial presentation was misleading (and I have found online many people sharing the same feeling).",1
4424,Very interesting!,5
4425,"Clear, concise and clean communication! Thank you!",5
4426,"Given this is the third (or fourth) iteration of this course, it's telling that the errors from the original release remain in the videos and quizzes. There are other, higher-quality Data Science MOOCs available.",1
4427,Great!,5
4428,This course was over my head academically and I was able to glean very little from it.,3
4429,"Too advanced, not enough Excel",1
4430,Not so relevant with real work.,3
4431,Very nice course.,5
4432,Very good Courses!,5
4433,"Probably the worst class I have ever taken on Coursera. The teacher asked us to do tons of things without explaining how and used tons of complicated math formulas without explaining what they were, what they did, or when and how to use them. There were also actual incorrect answers in the videos on occasion, so that even if you did do things correctly, you would think you were wrong and be confused, and there were a lot of inconsistencies between the spreadsheets used in the videos and the methods used to solve things compared to the actual spreadsheets given to us, which makes things pretty impossible to learn. If you're more advanced, it may be easier to find and understand the differences between the video and the spreadsheets, but the whole point of this class is that it is for beginners.",1
4434,"Really good course, I think the most value is at the end when you are able to apply the concept learned in the final assignment",4
4435,"Great class, however I felt it was very heavy on statistics and math concepts versus how to use Excel for data analysis. I would've liked to see some strategies on how to analyze large datasets, look for trends, and clean up bad data.",3
4436,Very helpful course. Intense concepts covered and good examples to master them. Thanks!,4
4437,"Awesome！However, you need knowledge of statistics.",5
4438,Good course,4
4439,A great course!!,5
4440,very good is increible this course for practice,5
4441,its very helpful,5
4442,I feel that the course does cover adequate topic to improve our mastery of data analysis in Excel. The course is more focus on the statistic and probability theory without giving adequate explanation on how to work on Excel.,2
4443,"good, but no material and lack of structure",3
4444,Very useful,4
4445,Not for beginners as promised. You need strong statistical skills to understand it.,1
4446,Really useful project :),5
4447,I thank Prof. Daniel for the clear exposition of the course.,5
4448,"It's quite interesting, but definitely not a beginners one. I'm put off quite a bit by the exclusively financial examples",3
4449,"Lots of good information. However, this course could be structured a lit bit better. More examples and small practice exercises within the lectures would significantly improve the retention of material.You should posses at least basic knowledge of statistics.",4
4450,Excellent instruction/instructor and great templates.,5
4451,"I would like to have more example, it feels there is mostly theory. The quizzes were super easy, I dropped out at final project, I couldn't get through the first questions. The course (and especially the final project) requires a good basis in statistics beforehand.The assistants are super helpful and patient.",3
4452,"I believe pivot tables also plays a big part in Excel, wish they could incorporate that too.",4
4453,"This course was somewhat challenging and having no experience in this at all it really paid off to learn about models. It would do me good to take a statistics course and i plan on doing so this upcoming semester, to maximize my benefits from a course like this.",5
4454,still needs a better way of explaining the diversity of the course,3
4455,It's not only basic Excel course but you can learn a lot of useful Excel functions like log or ln.,4
4456,"It´s an excellent courser, very dynamic and fun. You´ll learn a lot of usefull techniques to use in daily life or work",5
4457,Learning some great things!,4
4458,Very thorough and useful. Thank you so much.,5
4459,The course requires good knowledge of statistics as a pre-requisite.,1
4460,"very uesful for me ,i'am a student in china",5
4461,very practical course with understanding of business context,5
4462,This is a great course.,5
4463,"Unfortunately, the material and lectures of this course fell short of my expectations. Lectures don't follow a logical path and are all over the place, and some concepts are not expanded as required. Overall, I believe they need to improve how the content is presented, and how it's applied in a real world context.",1
4464,"The lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking. You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand. Just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project, in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project. The quizzes compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning. Overall I would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences.",2
4465,great statistic refresher and hands-on experience with excel,5
4466,"Being honest, the lessons in the course are disconnected with the weekly tests, specially for the final exam. Professor Daniel Egger and his assistan MUST improve the lessons, including examples step by step specially for the multiple linear regression su",1
4467,I never knew excel had so much possibilities,5
4468,"Very informative, and very challenging! The final project really challenges you to pull all of the concepts together in a real-world situation. That process helped solidify my understanding of the concepts.Would have liked to have had more explanation on linear regression, but overall everything was great. I have a much more concrete understanding of the basics of data modeling.",5
4469,"Very confusing stuff, need better clarification in course description and the way the material is transmitted to the student need to be reconsideredBut very well made and interesting.",2
4470,In the course info this is described as the first course in the series and that it requires no prior knowledge but the first week quiz contains questions referring to an equation 'discussed in the previous course'.,1
4471,after the second week I droped this course...I thought it will include excel and economics knowledge but was very wrong..,3
4472,This course is mostly theory based and certainly not what i am expected!,2
4473,"Was very frustrated with this course. Does not have a strong emphasis on Excel skills and the statistics models provided seem to be randomly chosen and poorly explained. Quizzes were interesting, but time-consuming because of the necessary extra research outside of provided lectures.",1
4474,Good content and practical examples.,5
4475,Great class,5
4476,"This course is good, but I feel it's too difficult. It would be good to suggest 'optional' prerequisite course if there is any. Thanks Dr. Egger.",3
4477,"I would have liked the class to be less theoretical, with more frequent explanations linking concepts to practical applications in daily / business life, in order to keep interest and motivation high and facilitate understanding and memorisation. It sure would help to enter this course with a certain background of probability. Those memories were too ancient in my case :-(",2
4478,"Quite an useful course for Excel application in business decision-making. But I think the final project is a little more difficult than weekly assignments. And only Quiz 1 has some hints about the potential problems we might come across during the quiz. The linear regression part, especially multivariate linear regression, need more explanations how to derive the matrix in Excel. Even though I followed every steps and referred other classmates' discussions, I cannot work out the matrix with Excel. So sad :(",4
4479,Clear and useful. But you need a text book to this course.,4
4480,Good but the final project could have been setup up with better instructions.,4
4481,"Excellent and reasonably challenging course. One of the courses that would be extremely hard without a solid foundation in maths.The final project is massive and time-consuming - I didn't see it coming and was surprised, not in a good way ;) You better start working on the final assignment since the beginning of the course.",5
4482,Very useful!!!,5
4483,good course for all,5
4484,"Good content, some materials were difficult but the video lecture were rushed.",4
4485,"Amazing volume of topics covered and in a manner that is not overly complicated in terms of testing methodology, but still requires you to do the work. There are still several bugs with the course, test answers and instruction documents on the site, but clearly the course is new so hopefully that will be resolved in coming iterations of the class.",4
4486,Thank you very much for great course.I have some difficult with this course and I did not finish it. Whatever the course was very interesting.,5
4487,Content not discussed in proper detail. Instructor skims over the concepts. Its difficult to follow.,2
4488,"The content is really interesting and useful. However, the way in which the lessons are organised I'd say is confusing. The professor explain you complex concepts like entropy or binary classification to continue with an excel worksheet. It's here where the issue relays, the excel files are filled and instead of learning by doing you have to figure out how the prof made the file. In consequence, the solution is always available.In my opinion, it'd be better if a raw data set is given and you build the model step by step from the scratch.",2
4489,"The course is more on analysis techniques as opposed to Excel shortcuts, tips and tricks. It certainly helps if you have a good background in algebra-level math; if you're looking for a course on how to be an Excel Power User, this might not be the best fit. Otherwise, what I learned here is useful for me. Thanks!",4
4490,"The method of the class is very useful, and teacher has a clear explanation and illustrated it very clearly. Thank you very much!",5
4491,Very good teachers/instructors.,5
4492,Videos fine. Quizes impossible to understand unless you take previous courses and have time to go through forums and more extra staff. It takes a lot of time. Not suggested unless you have it.,2
4493,"The later part of the sessions lacks practical applicability and it is more abstract, that I find difficult to relate",3
4494,Great course... Self Explanatory.. Loved the details.. Must take this one,4
4495,I would not recommend this course. It was very poorly planned and seemed thrown together.,1
4496,I wish the duration between each week was a bit more and there was an option to chat with the faculty directly,4
4497,This is more than just an Excel course. It also covers a lot of statistics and the application of statistics in Excel (with pre-built template). I think more focus on how to build things in Excel will be useful.,4
4498,"Course contents are rather deep which is good and makes it challenging. Explanations could be better and there should be more content on some topics for better understanding. Someone with background in statistics would find this course more useful than on who only has basic knowledge of statistics. Nevertheless, it inspired me to learn from other sources to fill the gaps in my understanding.",3
4499,Love it,4
4500,Extremely useful and easy to follow!,5
4501,"very useful, but hopefully, there will be some slides for learning.",5
4502,"The course gives you interesting analysis tools, but the title suggests you are going to learn new Excel tools, and you actually use it at a very low level.",3
4503,its very helpful course,4
4504,I learnt a lot from this course. The first week seemed very straight forward and I was worried the course was a bit too rudimentary. From there it stepped up four or five gears and I had to work hard to reinforce the concepts and apply the concepts.A really great course for any analyst or anyone seeking the true insight in data. The discussion board is a wealth of knowledge and a good read with tutors posting very plain english easier to understand answers to questions.,5
4505,"The whole course has very little about excel, rather about aweful a lot of data models. The course title is very misleading.",3
4506,If we would have use a real example to explain the concepts prof Eagger,4
4507,"Much work needs to be done on this course to make it friendly to learners. The quizzes and assignments do not align with what is taught in the lessons. Further, the content in the lessons does not even show or explain what is expected from the learning.I spent the majority of my time exploring the discussions to discover what I was supposed to be doing and the rest of it on Google teaching myself the concepts that were not taught in the course.",2
4508,"the course neither explains statistics properly, nor teaches how to use excel effectively, disappointed",1
4509,Great information included. I feel like I know much more about modelling data than when I started. The quizzes can be in that without the hints on the discussion forum I don't know how I would have completed them just based on the information in the videos.,4
4510,Excellent course. Focusses mainly on data analysis in Excel rather that teaching you all excel function. A good way to learn both. I recommend anyone interested in data analysis to take this course. The exercises are challenging to answer. It's fun solving them,5
4511,"For me a great course that tackle basics of data analysis that is usually done in much more advanced software.Thanks to Excel ""transparency"" it is very easy to understand those concepts.",5
4512,"If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. It wasn't an Excel class, rather it was a targeted business statistics class with only disjointed lectures and no benefit of textbook to actually help you learn. Lots of errors in the lectures and tests, and little to no support from course staff. Stay away! You won't regret it.",1
4513,Very good! Useful for both new learners and expertise.,5
4514,Meticulously designed for crisp understanding!,5
4515,"patctical and useful course,is better for your creer life. Thanks for sharing the knowledge.",5
4516,"This course was a great recap in math/statistics that I had totally forgotten about. Things were explained clearly, and the application of concepts was practical",5
4517,"Awesome course; it's not only about the tool, but mostly about the rationale behind what to do and how to do it.",5
4518,Very challenging course that is very insightful in the use of Excel for Data Analysis,5
4519,"im in week 4 , cant master data analysis in Excel",1
4520,Not much explanatory,3
4521,"Great course! I've learned a lot useful equations in business, and the appliance in excel.",5
4522,Great one,5
4523,Very challenging and wish there were more exercises throughout to strengthen understanding.,4
4524,I teach quantitative methods in a Business course at University of São Paulo (Brazil). This is an excelent course with fundamentals and very usefull applications.,5
4525,Loved the course! I still need to review some topics to make them clear in my mind but I really enjoyed! :D,5
4526,really helpful,5
4527,very good training.,5
4528,Amazing to get a grasp on the concepts! Might need further inmersion on the Excel area,4
4529,Turning what I learned in university about data analysis to a more practical approach.,5
4530,"Entering this course with a pretty in-depth knowledge of Excel, it was good to be able to brush up on some things I don't use on a day-to-day basis such as VLOOKUP and STANDARDIZE functions. The subject material is quite good, AOC and Binary Classifications were very interesting to learn about and have tons of applications, particularly in operation optimization problems/cases. One point of suggestion would be to double-check and clean up the accompanying Excel files. Some of the material was confusing to follow along with. If you could define cells, arrays, and tables for instance it would make the material much more intuitive to follow-along with.",4
4531,"Thank you very much, the lesson is very useful to me. in order to understand what the necessity of a function. and the professor clearly explains everything in the right pace.",5
4532,Great!,5
4533,They have a lot of good material. It will probably be better the second time around.,3
4534,"Very confusing lectures, he says you don´t have to have a basic level of excel to do the course but I didn´t find that true. Struggled through all of the lecture videos and the quizzes seemed to come out of left field.",1
4535,"Very poor material and instruction videos, with no logical flow or process.",1
4536,"The material is sort of interesting but there is not much hand-holding. I actually am an Excel beginner, and have merely an average grasp of mathematics. Before signing up, I read the prerequisites - there were none! It is advertised as a class for beginners, but I have found it beyond frustrating, and whats more I pre-paid for the specialization so this Excel class and the final project seem to be an utter waste of money without me going off to study Excel at length before trying the course again. Why not label it as an intermediate or higher class? I feel there should be a more obvious indication of the difficulty.",2
4537,good course,3
4538,"Very Useful, Eye-opener",5
4539,Very good those who want make their career in business analytic field,5
4540,absolutely one of the worst courses... I am deleting it from my list.no slides make it harder to follow.,1
4541,it's my first course on coursera .,5
4542,"Too much material, that moved too fast. Wasn't opportunity for enough feedback and explanation. I say this as someone who went to Duke and has taken similar classes at Duke!",2
4543,Great knowledge to build your own equity in decision making.,5
4544,Most concepts are rather theoretical and it feels more like a probability and stats course. There is not much focus on excel implementation and life is made seemingly easy with all the templates provided.,4
4545,"Warning: The lecture videos along will NOT be enough to prepare you for the final assignment! Be prepared to do your own research for the extra study materials. On the forum, many students said they had to drop out during the last week (probably without getting a refund!) because they were completely caught off guard by the huge knowledge gap between lectures and the final assignment. If you are determined to get the specialization certificate, you should definitely start the final assignment as early as possible. Don't wait until the last week or two!!",1
4546,"It has a lot of problems, including: Not so many lectures about excel itself - most of the time you will be watching videos about statistic methods. The lectures are very superficial, even though the quizzes and projects demand a lot of knowledge and time. The course seems to have a staff of one man: the professor of the course rarely replies (even though he did at the beginning of the session) and all the work seems to be done by his assistant, who tries his best, but ends up not coping with all the questions asked at the discussion forums.",2
4547,"Great course, great professor and great TA in community discussion. Can't give 5 stars as course introduction and content are not really matching. As per introduction anybody can take and learn this course, but indeed it is far from reality. If you don't have good math and statistic background then you better learn them first...I personally learnt a lot from this course even though could not get the certificate. Thanks everyone.",4
4548,Extremely helpful,4
4549,This is very essential course for the analysis of data using MS Excel,5
4550,"good course for combining stats and excel, but it is difficult for new learners with no knowledges on stats at all",4
4551,"Great idea. Unfortunately, the course is young and there were too many bugs to get past Week 2. Hopefully these will be finished my next session",2
4552,This course really helps in doing Analytics with the help of EXCEL,4
4553,"Good intro and fundamentals, but focuses far too much on finance.",3
4554,"Very good course. Loved Daniel's teaching. I have a request to make coming from healthcare/ lifesciences background and a starter to analytics it would be very very helpful if Daniel can include basic/ elementary videos on probability and statistics/ Bio-Statistics in this course to enable us to go deeper.Else a separate course on BioStatistics and probability would be WOW. Looking forward for more courses from Daniel.Thanks,Swetha",5
4555,"This course is very good! The inconvenient is the lack of exercices, however, the explanation are clear and relevant; we go to the basics.",4
4556,It will be better adding examples related with engineering cases (this is for technical people in any branch of engineering).,4
4557,Really Help me :),5
4558,Really interesting course and material and a very good instructor. This would be a 5 stars course if it wasn't for the final project. During lessons some concepts of statistics were taken as known (which is okay). However the final project required to utilize a combination of all new learned material on a whole different level of difficulty compared to the preceding quizzes. I did not expect that jump in difficulty and enjoyed the course a lot but the final project just was a struggle.,3
4559,Good topic and resources to learn. However the business terminologies sometimes are confusing.,4
4560,Thanks to Duke university for offering these professional courses free,4
4561,"it is too complicated for me this courese, not very useful for daily work. but anyway i",3
4562,Way too many abstract concepts that are not relevant to the challenges that I encounter in my day-to-day role. I wish this course would actually show me how to solve PRACTICAL business problems.The 2nd part of the course is not enjoyable at all. Sorry.,2
4563,No need to learn Excel so I'm to focus on the content. The professor examples are clear and like that he provides different perspectives to looking at a problem and makes it visual as well in order to conceptualized the idea first so I can commit it to my mind.,5
4564,"The course has some valuable information, however course materials and videos are not so helpful. If you already have some knowledge about statistics and excel, it will be a lot easier to follow the instructor's lectures, otherwise I don't feel how a beginner could really follow up on this course. Some topics are run through so quickly that they are confusing to students.",3
4565,The course is amazing and has introduced me to new frontiers of excel which will be helpful in my professional life.,5
4566,Great course! Excellent videos and good exercises.,5
4567,"Don't know how to apply the statistics and excel formula in real world situation. Besides, it becomes focus on approving statistics equation than teaching data analysis in excel",1
4568,Great Course! Thanks),5
4569,"Overall, the course is great except for some minor inconvenience of the lecture. Some concepts are not carefully explain like incidence etc",4
4570,Perfect course!,5
4571,"So many equations presented without explaining why these things work or how they are derived. I'm having a hard time seeing the relevance. Also, I learned a lot of these statistics in college and the explanations provided in these lessons actually confused me about things I already know. Very disappointed in this course. Especially since part 1 of the specialization was so good.",2
4572,Where is the course study material and are you providing a book on this subject and Excel? You have me lost.,1
4573,The course include structured elements and very usefull information to turn you quickly from beginner to master.,4
4574,More worksheets and examples would help :) the course is quite dense in terms of the number of topics covered,4
4575,GREAT ClASS!!!....The instructor is very good at explaining difficult topics the spreadsheets are very clear and comprehensive really enjoying this class,5
4576,A very good COURSE....i was looking it sinc a long timethank you COURSERA,4
4577,A bit very difficult course...full of formula,4
4578,"The course name is very misleading. While overall it is not a bad course, I believe a lot of people come here expecting very different material. Let's just put it this way: Mastering Data Analysis (mostly things to do with probability) with occasional use of Excel. Do not expect to learn anything new in excel.",2
4579,"The course deserves a 5-star rating because: (1) content is relevant, (2) the professor is concise and possesses great teaching skills, and (3) the learning modules are applicable to daily problems.",5
4580,"The transition is from easy to advanced. It gets really confusing, not sure if it's just me. I am not following the lessons anymore so I left the course.",2
4581,This course is amazing! Very useful for students who are looking for data-driven position. Thanks for sharing.,5
4582,Exactly what I was looking for!,5
4583,"Excellent course in excel tools, probability problems and theoretical thinking skills to apply to business problems!",5
4584,"Excellent Idea and concept, thank you!",5
4585,It's very useful to learn how excel able to handle different mathematical models,4
4586,The instructions are excellent. It really helps to learn the analytical functions in Excel,5
4587,great experience with great faculties and learning basics with smart ways thank you,5
4588,This is just awesome.,5
4589,please give some mechanism to refer my friends to this course from the website itself,5
4590,Excellent training in helping me to master excel.,5
4591,Exceptionally good.great experience.,4
4592,"Excellent course! I'm an electrical engineer, not an astronomer nor biologist. However, I've always been interested in both topics. This course delved into both just enough where I stayed focused and understood everything. Each course was extremely interesting and I learned many new things in each. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the science behind the search for extraterrestrial life!",5
4593,I specifically ' delayed' ending this course because I didn't want it to end . :),5
4594,"Very good, it was the perfect amendment for my studies in environmental informatics.",5
4595,"Highly interesting and informative course, it gives you a well balanced overview of the subject and act as a springboard to delve further into the study of the Universe and its marvels. Personally I really enjoyed professor Cockell's lessons, I found him amiable and his teaching clear.If anything, I would say it is advisable to have a second source of information concerning space missions and science discoveries as some of these go back to 2013-2014, when the course was likely prepared.",5
4596,This is a good introduction about Astrobiology. I'll continue my research about this specific topic with lot of interest.,4
4597,This was a very informative and comprehensive introduction to the topic of Astrobiology. It was an enjoyable and challenging course to participate in.,5
4598,"The syllabus needs a bit of update, as many new developments happened since this course was put together. Nonetheless, still very much relevant as an introduction to astrobiology.",4
4599,"AMAZING! Very very clear, easy for individuals with little to no science background to follow. Extremely interesting and spilling with knowledge. Hopeful for a further course to become available!Biomedical Science student",5
4600,It is a very comprehensive course and it covers a broad range of topics.,5
4601,"Very interesting stuff. Nice use of static imagery, but might have made more use of video.",4
4602,Amazingly interesting! Never throught i could be so interested in Astrobiology before!,5
4603,It was short :(,5
4604,"Very interesting course. A good introduction into Astrobiology, for an aspiring Space student like me. Well worth the time, short lectures. Summary after each course is the best part. I will come back and watch the videos. Thank you, Professor Charles!",5
4605,"General introductory course to astrobiology. Concepts are explained simply enough for anyone to understand, but the course omits detailed physics so advanced students might find the course lacking. Course is very approachable for first time students.",5
4606,"Great introductory course on Astrobiology/Exobiology. It provides relevant background to understand what this is all about. I wish there would be more external pointers, recommended readings, and a next stage.",5
4607,Thought provoking course and very interesting.,5
4608,Mr. Cockell is the best. His teachings is so good and it can be seen that he is so passionate about the Astrobiology and he is very engaging. It is like story telling. The concepts are so clearly given and the assessments do question your knowledge.,5
4609,"I've really enjoyed every lecture and learned a lot , Thank you Prof. Charles :))",5
4610,"Although the course doesn't seem to be practically used because we haven't found any ET Life yet.I have learnt so much about Astrobiology. It also reminds me, an Aerospace Engineering student to prepare for the coming of aliens.\(^o^)/YES!\(^o^)/YES!",5
4611,Good course. A few sections could be updated and some materials seen more in-depth.,4
4612,I really enjoyed the course. Wish there was more. It is a facinating subject. The videos are very clear and very easy to listen to.,5
4613,"Excellent course, basic information for the people who are interested in astrobiology, and the origins of life in universe",5
4614,"Sir Charles cockell,thank you for such an amazing and beautifully designed course on astrobiology.Theres so much that I learnt from it.Wish to meet u and take up more courses related to this amazing science...you are my inspiration sir.Thank you.Tejas",5
4615,Nice basic course on astrobiology,5
4616,it's very helpful course,5
4617,"Excellent course, well organized and good summaries after each lecture.",5
4618,This was a simple and interesting course I would love it to be a little bit broader and present the information in more context. But still excellent course.,4
4619,Very interesting,5
4620,Great course!!! I could learn much more about the Universe. My best regards.,5
4621,Excellent teacher and very nice videos,5
4622,"Very good introductory course that embraces a broad range of topics. The depth of coverage, however, is somewhat shallow in comparison to other scientific courses aimed at beginners, such as the outstanding 'Origins' course from the University of Copenhagen.",4
4623,Amazing.I want to work on a project/research on this topic. This course is very nice,5
4624,I thought this was an excellent clear introduction with its succinct simple clear lecture format that was was easily complete in just under 2 hours each week,5
4625,The teaching methods and pace were quite fine but it lacked a bit of media presentation pizzazz. It was definitely sufficient but could've been a little better production quality-wise. The professor had an amiable vibe and definitely seem to be a master of his field. I enjoyed it and plan to resume.,4
4626,"Very intensive course, definitely very well detailed and thorough. The tests often rely on paying attention to the smallest details of the lecture, which while frustrating, forces you to learn. Its one of the hardest courses on here, but also the most rewarding when you finish it.",4
4627,Absolutely brilliant course. I understand the subject so much better now. Charles Cockell is an excellent lecturer.,5
4628,Really enjoyable and with enough detailed information. I totally recommend this course to anyone interested in a good introduction to the field of astrobiology. Professor Cockell comunicates the contents clearly and makes you feel engaged. It was a wonderful learning experience.,5
4629,This course is just right for someone curious about the subject.,5
4630,"Astrobiology is one of the most interesting field in science having profound implications in our view of our daily life. The course has been framed to provide a basic understanding of concepts involved in the field of Astrobiology. Professor Charles Cockell was just amazing to dramatizes events spanning more than 4 billion years of our Planet. The lectures had the materials and stuff to stimulate a persons curiosity, to wonder about his origin and the place in this cosmos. The lecture makes one ponder and was very connective in a deeper sense. TOTALLY EXTRA-TERRESTIAL!",5
4631,Thank you so much for this course! It was really interesting.,5
4632,Took me years to finish this course... I am slow at my education and i loved how i could work at my own pace. So glad i stuck to it.Thank you professor!,5
4633,It's really awesome,5
4634,I am really enjoying this course. The content is displayed clearly providing a good overview of what astrobiology is.,4
4635,I found this course very interesting and learned a lot.,5
4636,pretty hard but really interesting,5
4637,beautiful and interesting course,4
4638,"While a decent overview, the course is a bit dated (2012), One thing that would be nice, is having the key topics that are being talked about, show up on the backdrop. Sometimes, there too much information being presented too quickly.",4
4639,It is an interesting and easy to understand overfiew of the topic. I recommend it for newbies to the topic and those who just want to refresh basic knowledge they might have gathered in other courses.,5
4640,"Good course, gently showing an introduction. Had the playspeed at 1.25x the entire time though, otherwise they talked too slow.",3
4641,"This is a well-made course with interesting lectures and a great professor. I'm very passionate about anything ""astro"" related and this was for me an introduction into the field of astrobiology. Beginner friendly.",5
4642,Great Class,5
4643,"I really enjoyed it, the first modules where the ones i consider more important and tho it was pretty informative i would like to recommend the update of a few lectures and data of the same. In the case of the arrival of the spacecraft new horizons, i mean. But in general i really liked it, it compliments my college formation.",5
4644,Great class! The topic is fascinating and the lectures are clear and well articulated. I strongly recommend this course.,5
4645,course kept wanting me to verify and give them a picture of me,4
4646,"Great Course! Highly recommend. I especially liked the sections on origins of life and habitability. The lectures were packed with info but short enough to absorb. Loved the professor's presentation, as well. He was engaging and positive, but not over the top with enthusiasm.",5
4647,I really enjoyed everything I have learned and honestly was so clearly laid out. Thank you so much for this!,5
4648,"This course has been extremely helpful, captivating, and thoroughly enjoyable! I learned so much from this course, and it has only intensified my interest and curiosity for this field.PROS:-Oganization and structure of the content-Balanced in terms of duration, difficulty, etc.-Delivery of the instructor, who was very engaging and maintained interest throughout the course, and his personal interest and knowledge in this field was clearly evident.-The assignments were well weighted, relevant, and a good indicator of my understanding of the course content.CONS:-None!So thank you to the instructor, the institute, and everyone else involved in providing this wonderful course. I look forward to more in the future!",5
4649,I missed math.,4
4650,"Excellent course, I learned a lot but I think it should have some peer reviewed assignments, like a little research on some topic, so that you have to look for information and learn a lot more in the process.",4
4651,Second time to take this class. Awesome!,5
4652,"Class is WELL WORTH TAKING! Very intense, comprehensive and quite informative. Professors are well worth listening to!",5
4653,"I'm already a Biology student, I took this course despite the language barrier because is not teached in many universities, I know Edinburgh has a long university teaching tradition, and I enjoyed the teachings.",5
4654,Very well done course. Lots of insight and community support.,5
4655,"Very interesting and compact intro to astrobiology. Only meat, excellent way to start with Astrobiology. I want to thank prof. Charles Cockell for his work.",5
4656,"Brilliant, really interesting course, with an enthusiastic and clear lecturr.",5
4657,Truly fascinating and phenomenal course. I wish there were more like it!,5
4658,"Great course, Charles does a great job teaching the course! opens up the possibilities of the origins of life and other possible life in our solar system and universe. thanks to Coursera.",5
4659,Excellent introductory course on the topic. Thank you Dr. Cockell.,5
4660,Very Good course. The teacher is very clear and enthusiastic.,5
4661,Loved the brief lectures and well structured layout. Definitely a must for those stepping into this wonderful area of multidisciplinary research!,4
4662,A great beginning course. Well taught. Thank you.,5
4663,"I really enjoyed this course. It threw me, at first, that the whole course was only lectures -- no videos or readings -- but so much of this course will be applicable to teaching biology that it's useful no matter what. I also had a small problem with verifying quizzes on my phone.",4
4664,Great course with excellent learning material and clear explanations. I learnt a lot and would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in astrobiology and the search for life outside of our planet.,5
4665,"5 stars, it's more. Great course would advise this to anyone. Thank you for the experence",5
4666,"Great content and learning experience. Informative and enjoyable course, great lecture presentations and support materials.",5

4668,Well organized and very informative.,5
4669,Great introduction to this really interesting topic - thank you :-),5
4670,"Very informative, easy to follow, and well explained.",5
4671,"Amazing, interesting and mind boggling course with a great teacher.",5
4672,"It is very important to me to understand other things about the Universe. It's a complementary knowledge over the geology , that is the course that I made before in the University.",5
4673,"A very good course, very well presented and didactic.It would be interesting if it were upgraded to the latest results (2013-2015)regardless, I recommend it to everyone interested.",4
4674,"Interesting, But Monotonous. Great Resources And Loving It! :)",4
4675,I enjoyed a lot :),5
4676,I developed a keen interest in Astrobiology after reading one of Dan Brown's books and this course has nurtured my interest. It has made me sure of what I want to pursue in the future.,5
4677,Gives a basic idea about possible extraterrestrial life and how origin of life on Earth.,5
4678,"Very interesting material and well explained, but videos are quite plain - borderline boring.",3
4679,Great course So far has taught me alot of things i didnt know and some things i needed to brush up on. well recommended,5

4686,"Very interesting and informative, laconic and focused. The lecturer is great.",5
4687,Thoroughly Enjoyed!,5
4688,"About the contents, I was expecting maybe less biological charge and a bit more about astronomy, but maybe that was my mistake. The teacher makes a great job, and I have been learning both astrobiology and English. About practicing English while studying another subject, I would like to appreciate the synchronizing of the subtitles, that were perfect.I totally recommend this course to anyone interesting in solar system, astronomy, biology and the search for extraterrestrial inteligence.",4
4689,"Really enjoyable course - this was my second time of taking it as I wanted to revise the topic. This time around I didn't have the time to engage in the forums as much, and found that I missed the lively discussions there.",5
4690,"Concise and fascinating overview of this subject, which left me yearning to learn more!",5
4691,A lot of g,4
4692,"I really enjoyed this course. I felt like some of the videos from the first week were a little too long, I preferred the shorter ones, and there was a mix up where the second week ended up being due before the first week which threw me off a little but the content itself was very interesting and I'm glad I took part in it.",5
4693,"I REALLY love this course. I love learning new things all the time, and this course really helps with that. It puts new perspectives in your mind and allows you to think further into things you may or may not have already known. Very interesting course, always mind grabbing.",5
4694,It was a great course and not easy!,5
4695,Best course ever! Charles is the best of teachers. You´ll enjoy every single one of the lectures and will never want it to be over.,5
4696,"Excellent! Professor Cockell obviously has a passion for his field and I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures. I learned much more than I expected as the course is fully detailed, well organized and the quizzes were challenging. I found the whole experience a pleasure. Thank you Professor!",5
4697,"Very interesting and engaging course. There are longer and more in-depth courses if you want them but if you want a concise overview of astrobiology on your own time, then this course is perfect!",5
4698,"Very good course. The instructer is clear in what he wants us to learn, and uses a great selection of visuel repressentations.This course earns 5 stars indeed",5

4700,A very thorough introduction on a unique subject!,5
4701,"Extremelly interesting material and good wrapping, I enjoyed watching lectures. Guess I'll continue studying biology as the course made me think about things and I need more info. Thanks a lot, great course",5
4702,Excellent presentation and very interesting course,5
4703,Fantastic class. Shows the need for interdisciplinary studies and why space exploration is essential to understanding how life began on earth. The lecures are interesting and the concepts well explained.,5
4704,"Very interesting topic, I had previous knowledge about exoplanets and formation of the Earth and solar system which was helpful but not necessary to understand the concepts in the course. The weekly assignments kept me engaged in the course even though I was taking it without credit.",5
4705,Someone did their homework in putting this course together; well done.,5
4706,Wonderful course.I took it just to satisfy my curiosity. I really enjoyed listening to the lectures and doing the quizzes. Many thanks to the professor for taking the time to make it.I would be happy to see a more advanced version.,5

4709,An introdutrory course but very well taught.,5
4710,Exactly what I was looking for on the matter!!!,5
4711,Really enjoyed this course. The videos were really interesting and full of facts and information. I would recommend anyone with an interest in the extra terrestrial or sci-fi to do this course. Some of the content will be a real eye opener to those looking to the sky for little green men!!,5
4712,"This course was amazing! I hope the course will be updated in the near future with more depth to current exploration. I personally would suggest the New Horizon Mission, The Rosetta Mission, the ""discovery"" of Enceladus' subsurface global ocean, and/or Stephen Hawking's $100 million prize.",5
4713,"I love this course, it gave me the basic idea of how life could and couldn't start with one situation or another. The impact of some element in our life and how alternative elements have smaller chance to be the backbone of life is not a common thing to think in my everyday life (a fresh air for me)I have difficulty to remember all the project that we all do to search the extraterrestrial life though XD...this course make me think that I now have a basic scientific facts to start build a new story about the early life in earth <3 oh my god, thanks a lot sir!! (^u^)v",4
4714,Instructor was boring,1
4715,Thank you so much for this course! It was very interesting and opened my eyes to so many new aspects of extraterrestrial life!,5

4728,Very nice course. Specially the instructor is very helpful & knowledgeable person. I am very much grateful to The University of Edinburgh for providing this course.,5
4729,Very interesting and easy.,4
4730,"This is a terrific course! I really enjoyed Dr. Cockrell's lecture style. He is very articulate and presents and explains the material very well. The photos and graphics were very useful for following the lectures and understanding the material.I found the ""What Have We Learned"" summaries after each lecture very helpful. I would like to take more courses offered by Dr. Cockrell in the future.",5
4731,"This was a very interesting and entertaining course, I enjoyed it a lot and can only recommend it. Thanks!",4
4732,Very interesting and informative.,5

4735,Very interesting and very well explained.,5
4736,I would like to send my thanks to the professor for sharing the course and all the assistants for the efforts you have done. The classes are very interesting and I enjoyed my time while following the classes as well as doing the quiz.,5
4737,"This was fun. As a novice to both astronomy and astrobiology, I thought it was a nice introduction.",5
4738,"Almost perfect (for the intro level it was designed for). I would suggest that next time, if possible, instructor image could be a little smaller and the actual images illustrating the points he is talking about a little bigger and more diverse. But that is a minor, please, don't get me wrong. The course was very very good, thank you a lot. Also, the off-line written forum-style discussions were very very good.",4
4739,Wonderfully engaging course that was fun to take and inspires one to learn more about the exciting field of Astrobiology.,5
4740,"This good course; but I have none of those cards, as I can do to pay the course",4
4741,"Very interesting material, and very well explained. The course is slightly out of date, and a couple of the test questions were poorly worded (mostly, these were corrected), but overall it is educational and fun to participate in. I enjoyed it and I learned even more about something that interested me.",4
4742,"I learned a lot from this course. It did feel like some of the videos were out of order in the first two weeks of the class. Overall, it was very interesting and I now know more about a subject I was unfamiliar with previously.",4
4743,Very interesting and informative to get a general overview. Could go a bit more in detail in some techniques and informations.,4
4744,The material could be exciting but the presentation is dull. The pass mark on the quizzes is around 80%. As these courses are supposed to be for interest why do you need 80% to pass?,2
4745,Great course that is interesting and engaging. Well taught and fun!,5
4746,"Amazing! Thank you professor. Easily one of the best professors I've come across. The course was not too complicated, at the same time it was extremely understandable. May there be many more courses like this on the subject (as it develops and spreads worldwide). Cheers! Highly recommended. Thanks again! Thank you Coursera!",5
4747,Thanks for sharingSincerelyProf Héctor Manuel Castillo GómezPd. Ido not know how send you $29 dollars for certify.I dont have credit cardsorry,5
4748,"Good course,it gives me more understanding about astrobiology and extraterrestrial life.Thanks.",5
4749,"Very interesting, the professor is a great teller. Unfortunately the tests in week 4 are pretty bad, and the order of the lectures in week 1 and 2 seems off. Well worth 5 stars without these two imperfections.",4
4750,Super good course,5
4751,Great introduction to the field of astrobiology. Captivating and very interesting - only problem is that it is too short. I would love to learn more !,4
4752,The pronunciation of the lector was more than awful! His English is quite unsuitable for video lectures! It was just a torture listening to him!,2
4753,Great introduction to a fascinating subject. It covered a variety of topics at an accessible level.,5
4754,This must be the most relevant information one could acquire in this age! So very grateful!,5
4755,"A simple yet extensive overview of Astrobiology. The learned Professor has managed to communicate the grandeur and excitement of Astrobiology without intimidating us with technical details, yet not leaving out anything.A great effort and accomplishment.",5
4756,Very goof introduction. Maybe a little bit short on some subjects.,5
4757,Great introductory course!!Definitely urging me to pursue more Astrobiology courses!,5
4758,Really cool stuff for profanes :-),5
4759,Great course! I learned so much about this immensely interesting field. I would recommend it anyone. I am currently taking classes mostly about computer programming on Coursera but I saw this class and had to sign up. I am so glad I did!,5
4760,Very informative and I learned a lot with this course. It was made very interesting and there was not a dull moment in the whole course.,5
4761,"The professor explained all the issues clearly. The lectures cover many interesting aspects of astrobiology.I would wish for more updated news though. For example, the New Horizons spacecraft has already reached Pluto.",4
4762,The summary of each lesson is excellent.,5
4763,Excellent and very interesting presentation of a wonderful subject.,5
4764,"A comprehensive and fascinating introduction to astrobiology. The course is delivered by an excellent team and offers valuable insight into the cutting-edge field.I would just like to mention to anyone thinking of taking this course that while it is indeed catered to beginners, there are some sections in which it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of cell biology (ultrastructure in particular) as technical terminology is used and could potentially be overwhelming without some prior knowledge.However this only applies to a small part of the course and the rest is very much accessible. Highly recommended.",5
4765,"Very informative, well organized and well presented. My only complaint is that the class was a little on the short side, and it could have went into more detail at a couple of points. I would still recommend the course, regardless of length (and have).",4
4766,This is a very interesting course looking at the rise of life on Earth and what that can teach us about how life may have emerged on other planets.,4
4767,i've learned tons of new things. i would like to have more materials on the subject. could the staff attach some recommended readings? other courses? than you for making this course :),5
4768,"Prof Cockell opens the door of astrobiology for me. Before passing this course my knowledge about Extraterrestrial life and life on the other planets was about the Hollywood movies. Now I can understand when the scientists talking about ""life"" what is the term ""life"" is suppose to be.",5
4769,This is a very good course and very useful for everyone who is interested in the Astrobiology field. Thank you very much COURSERA for adding this course.,5
4770,"This course was really great, and I don't say that lightly. The instructor was knowledgeable and thorough, the problems were clearly defined and discussed, added insight to key areas of focus were provided by instructors from past courses allowing for recap, and the problem was thoroughly interesting.",5
4771,Dr. Richard Meisler did a great job at engaging the student about this very current and pressing matter. I want to thank him and those who he interviewed over the whole course for taking the time to make this available online. I am inspired to help others who are effected by HIV/AIDS. I hope to one day be able to utilize my time into helping others.,5
4772,"when i did this couse i spected to learn more about the bology of the virus, anyway i really enjoyed this course and i have learnt a lot!",4
4773,"It is just everything in one course: wisdom, social issues, history, story, biology (simply explained), health, drugs, stigma, families, people, lives! It goes around the world, it kills ghosts for people who's been followed by years of uncertainty.",5
4774,very enlightening and educative,5
4775,"I thank Dr. Meisler, and everyone else involved in this course for their excellent work and for enabling me to obtain the knowledge that I have acquired studying this course. Well done.",5
4776,"It is very interesting, comprehensive and useful course! I am sad because certificate is not for free...",5
4777,Great course! Thoroughly enjoyed lectures and learning more about HIV/AIDS from various perspectives.,5
4778,"It was a wonderful experience. It was great to know about the AIDS epidemic, role of different presidents regarding AIDS, its transmission, testing, counseling, vaccine, anti-retroviral therapy, prevention, problems as a result of anti-retroviral therapy, and a lot more. To grasp more information about AIDS epidemic and various HIV+ cases, the suggested books and referred movies were simply remarkable. Dr. Meisler has explained many aspects that might help one in future research for better treatment of HIV+ patients.",5
4779,This class is filled with useful information and the outside resources it references are also great. The material in the class is presented in a clear and compassionate manner. It's a class worth taking to better understand AIDS/HIV and the role the disease plays throughout the world.,4
4780,"The course is very heavy emotionally, but completely necessary.",5
4781,it was very fun,5
4782,This is an amazingly thoughtful and thought provoking course. The care and time taken to build this course is nothing short of incredible especially as it is offered free of charge to students. This was a wonderful educational experience that has solidified my educational goals of going into the field of epidemiology with focus on persons living with HIV/AIDS. Words cannot express my gratitude for Dr. Meisler and the amazing participants in this course; it is nothing short of a blessing.,5
4783,"Enjoyed this course. It is a course I would recommended to anybody who wants to learn about politics, Government, Medical research and Activism that is formed from the characteristics of a disease. I wish for a cure to come up faster.",5
4784,"I did not watch every single video (I watched it initially for a school project so I had to cherrypick videos) but have definitely learnt so much from all the interviews that the professor has compiled for us and see from different aspects, e.g. political, legal, socio-economic factors, even literature, that have shaped our society's view on HIV patients.The professor has left very positive note and resonance for us to be aware of HIV and how to change our community by being aware of it. It is truly a meaningful course and I just want to give a huge thank you to University of Michigan for this MOOC.",4
4785,"This course provides a concise and balanced look at the aids epidemic,and social responsibility and response to it. I think it is comprehensive in the resources that we can access, additional videos, books, professionals, advocates and patients. Definitely a good starting off point for someone who wants a detailed introduction to the topic. I will review the materials again and again. Thank you. Good job.",5
4786,"Wonderful course, a lot the information and resource!",5
4787,"It explored How HIV was diagnosed, what are all the actions taken Globally to combat pandemic.",4

4791,Very usefull course. Good explanation about the disease and actual course.,4
4792,"Very complete, interesting and exciting. A great experience! Dr. Meisler is a wonderful person.",5
4793,"This interesting course focuses on the social and political aspects of this well-known virus. Interesting is as well the historical information provided and that different countries around the world are highlighted and how various presidents dealt with the epidemic. The focus on stigma is amazing, as this has a big influence on the disease. I would have preferred to have some more information about the bio-medical aspects of HIV to gain a complete understanding. However, I would definitely recommend this course to somebody that wants to create a more complete understanding of HIV/AIDS.",4
4794,Amazing course! It opens our mind to the world in which all people are equal nonetheless what disease they have. Everyone should consider taking this course.,5
4795,"This was a wonderful course. I've learned so much, and I really appreciate it.",5
4796,"Incredibly engaging! This course provides an excellent multi-discipline approach to understanding HIV/AIDS that not only focuses on the medical background, but delves into the cultural, social, and political factors that have impacted the disease. The professor is amazingly knowledgeable and has structured this course in such an engaging and organized way. Now, I feel empowered to bring this education to the community I will be serving during my Peace Corps service. Taking this course was one of the best decisions I have ever made!",5
4797,Very much enjoyed the knowledge obtained and the additional reading material.,5
4798,Really good course! Amazing interviews,5
4799,"Wonderfull course. I highly recomend it. All the professors and people invited to share experiences are very well prepared, they speak in a way that it easy to understand. I learned a lot and realized that as a general doctor from another country still need so much to learn about just the basics of this epidemy. I loved it.",5
4800,Excellent and engaging course,5
4801,"This course has been an useful approach for me to AIDS history.The point is focused on United States but also I Could learn something more of AIDS over the world.I was hoping to learn more over AIDS, and I did it. But also I learned over people. People who are HIV +, people who care and recent part of our history.",4
4802,Very informative and thorough.,5
4803,The content might be great but the teachers don't seem to enjoy presenting the course at all. They are basically reading from a script. Very monotonous atmosphere.,2
4804,wonderful and comprehensive introduction to infections !,5
4805,I love it!,5
4806,Great. Tanks you.,5
4807,"Interesting and well structured, easy to follow. Some videos were a bit too long, but the concepts were well explained. Everything was clean and clear. I enjoyed it.",4
4808,I really enjoyed this course. I have learnt a lot new things and upgraded on what I already knew. I recommend this to every one interested in understanding microbial resistance,4
4809,Really enjoyed this excellent course. Stretched me and gave me a great basic understanding of biofilms.,5
4810,Excellent course; the presenters' English is a little difficult to understand at times but nothing too incomprehensible.,5
4811,"Thank you team who put together a great effort. I appreciate this opportunity to refresh my education as microbiologist, in the infectious diseases caused by bacteria. The extra readings were really refreshing, and would like to learn more about combination of treatment/usage of two or more antibiotics and other actions to eradicate chronic infections. Two thumbs up for motivating broader (international research) on biofilms. I found good correlation with PCR findings and follow-up of evolution thanks to conscientious collection of identified pathogens to compare throughout the years within and between patients to understand evolution and estimate best ways of treatment. Thank you again.",5
4812,"interesting content but not well presented. faculty read the script and struggled with pronunciation, fluency and generally engaging presentation. Combination of basic content on the one hand and highly specialised information / terminology without explanation on the other was not helpful to learning.",2
4813,very informative and interesting,5
4814,Excellent presentations with engaging graphics. Worthy of time and thought,5
4815,Fantastic! Really fascinating and informative quality training from experts in their field. Great resources and really interesting presentations on complex subjects.,5

4819,"Great course, very complete and funtional. Help me to understand some things that i dont have clear about biofilms and infetions. I will do more course with this university.",5
4820,"It proved invaluable to me as it clarified my concepts relating to infections, especially those which occur with change of season in India and their treatment protocols advised in ancient Ayurvedic text.",5
4821,"My name is Adithya C.G. I am studying in my sophomore and final year of my M.Tech Industrial Biotechnology course (Master's) at SASTRA University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India (2015-2017 batch). The course is very informative. The videos are excellent.",5
4822,So far so good..I enjoy each and every lecture,5
4823,This course was very insightful and interesting. The lectures was very good and I liked the recommended scientific articles that we could download and read for extra information. I would definitely recommend this course.,5

4826,"The course was very useful, and interesting as well. :) I always like when people talk about what's there to discover and work out yet, not only what we already know.",5
4827,Very enjoyable and well presented.,5
4828,"Perfect!!! So, I had high expectations when I started the course and all were overcome. I recommend the course to all who wish to start some work, however slight, with biofilms. I congratulate the entire team of teachers.",5
4829,This is a truly brilliant course that shines a light on the dark world of the biofilm. The lecturers are excellent in bringing a quite difficult subject alive. The course introduces the secrets of bacteria to us and how they change from a simple infection to a long term (some times) debilitating chronic infections such a sinusitis and artificial knee joint infections. I found it fascinating that these simple organisms were clever enough dodge the bodies considerable defences and then join with others to form biofilms - which are like little communities working together with the aim of a bodily take over. Quite fascinating!! Furthermore - the lecturers introduce the idea of antibiotics and how they work to push these little invaders back!! Enjoy and learn,5
4830,very helpful course,5
4831,"This course is not just for microbiologists. There are tons of clinical gems for all types of clinicians working with surgical patients or chronic wounds.I think it is a must for all primary healthcare, GPs, chiropractors and physiotherapists.An excellent course! Extremely well put together and presented. I highly recommend.",5

4846,very specific and a lot of information,5
4847,"It is a very beneficial course,though it is quite difficult.I do learn a lot from this course.",5
4848,This course is really nice! Normal courses are superficial with basic knowledge. I really like the way of researchers introducing their area and talking about the recent related publications. It is a proper course for college or post-graduate student in this area! Thank you for making so much effort!,5
4849,I found it very hard to understand the lecturers and what they were saying.,1
4850,"This course gives a deep knowledge on how biofilms form, behave, distribute and affect the human body. I found it very interesting and useful. The professors explain the material clearly and the animations give a clear idea on how the processes occur. Thank you!",5
4851,I really enjoyed the course and learned a great deal. The instructors were very good.,5
4852,This will help me to understand more about Biofilm.,5
4853,"Very good definitions about each topic, concise presentations, clear. Teachers with broad expertise on the subject.",5
4854,"I liked this course a lot. I joined this course to understand the cause of bacterial infections during surgery. My mom is suffering from somewhat similar condition after having a surgery, so I wanted to know the cause of it. I got much more knowledge than expected. I am Microbiology student and I am doing PhD. Medical microbiology was always my topic of interest and to get better knowledge about biofilms this course is best. I would recommend this course to all the microbiology studying students.",5
4855,very great course the variety in doctors every lesson is a very great thing but the assignment and asking about the names of bacteria is really hard and there is no enough data about why they are called that so it is really hard i hope you can add a lesson clarifing the names of bacteria,4
4856,"Efficient, relevant and well-formatted introduction to the topic! Great job!",4
4857,"Excellent teaching, the diagrams and knowledge of the lecturers is great. I turned the subtitles on as lots of the words were complex, so would recommend doing this for others. Tests were rather easy but the course was full of interesting information.",5

4879,"The course was good, but there was a flaw in a fact that there were several lecturers. Some fact were repetitive, especially the interviews didn't bring anything new, and the tests sometimes were too specific. Anyway, I find the information given in this course extremely useful. The last module was the most exiting one, with clear structure and some really interesting themes to discover.",4
4880,five star course. really enjoying the presentations,5
4881,A very good introductory course !!,5
4882,very informative,5
4883,"Bacteria are among the most import forms of life that ever existed, and to comprehend its biology is pivotal to human welfare and health. This course deliveries with flare high education from one of the most pretigious universities in Europe. I strongly recommend this increadibly interesting course to anyone who wants to learn about the fascinating world of biofilms and chronic infections.",4
4884,"Very detailed description of bacteria behavior. It gets very technical, but anyone curious about health with respect to bacteria's role can learn something from this course.",4
4885,"Very good context, yet the modules could be better distinguished.",4
4886,Excellent! I would recommend to all those working on bilingual education and consulting for parents about it.,5
4887,I loved the course because I surely learned a lot!!! Thank you!,5
4888,"Thanks for providing lots of interesting materials! As for me, i would prefer having more advanced tests and tasks as the given ones did not really help me remember the materials. I would also appreciate having some additional materials on the brain areas in this course, since this area was completely new to me.",3
4889,Very useful and scientific oriented,4
4890,"Great lecturer giving an up-to-date and accessible state of the research on the bilingual brain, based on a wide range of studies including his own. Great way to get a sense of what neuropsychology is for beginners. I was expecting more on how bilingualism influence the way we think / process information / create, but the response has been that things are much more complex than that... I recommand this course to anyone curious about bilingualism.",5
4891,"The content of this course is really interesting and intriguing, but it would better if there are additional sources and information. Also, instead of mainly picture the teacher in the video, it would be nice if there could be more graphics and diagrams to illustrate the idea that the professor is trying to convey. Besides those minor deficiencies, I would say that this is a really good course and will worth your time.",4
4892,"A great course for those who are interested in the fascinating bilingual research going on in area. Clearly stated, up-to-date literature shared.",5
4893,Very well designed course for effective outcomes. This course has helped me a lot to take constructive steps to improve my classroom experiences. Now my students as well as I are enjoying the classes. I used to use certain techniques only for a limited area of my lessons but this course helped me to understand and discover more ways to incorporate art with other subjects. It has also improved my own learning experiences. I am highly grateful to get the opportunity to take the course. Thanks a lot to Coursera. Special thanks to Lisa Mazzola and Stephanie Pau.,5
4894,A great balance between theory and practice,5
4895,Fantastic course to learn how to teach art in schools!,5
4896,Very interesting and useful for teaching in the classroom and outdoor,5
4897,This course is so helpful for art teacher. thank you Coursera,5
4898,Really useful with great ideas.,5
4899,Amazing course!,5
4900,Great course! Loved it! Will be back to do more! Thanks!,5
4901,Outstanding course! I am a museum docent and found strategies presented extremely successful for museum teaching..,5
4902,"Great course, with an amazing approach and fantastic material. For every one who loves arts, not only teachers, art students, if you do love art, join it and enjoy it.",5
4903,"The articles that were limited were actually somewhat helpful. The google hangouts seemed lackluster and draining. I would recommend more substance in the videos, or MoMA might switch to an article/book MOOC that doesn't rely as much as people talking about their opinion without a ton of evidence or support. Wouldn't recommend participating in this MOOC",1
4904,wonderful course . I am waiting to see how I have faired .,5
4905,I like the concept but I was expecting for more video lecture.,4
4906,I like MoMA courses and wish MoMA good luck!,5
4907,"I found this course very helpful in making me rethink the way I teach - moving from a lecture mode where I present information to students whilst they force themselves to try and focus or fall asleep to teaching using questions whilst inserting information at helpful points to guide the conversation. I am a homeschooling Mum and a church pastor, and in both those settings I have found this course to be very insightful and transformational in the way I teach and can promote creative thinking and engagement with students.",5
4908,I just loved the course. Everything fit my schedule and activities.,5
4909,It's seemingly a great course for K-12 teachers but lacks relevance for higher education.,2
4910,I´m new in online courses but I´m learning everyday. MoMA,5
4911,"As with the other MoMA class, I found it very helpful for use with my 9th and 10th grade English classes. Thank you for the insights!",5
4912,I really love all courses from MOMA... they are very professional,5
4913,Wonderfull course,5
4914,"Very helpful, inspiring and informative.",5
4915,Just as excellent as the other one was! Thank you so much! Can't wait to start Modern Art and Ideas!!!,5
4916,Excellent course. I have recommended Coursera and MoMA to several educators in my county.,5
4917,Humble; humanizing; full of culture; EXCELLENT.,5
4918,Fantastic course!!! It open me a new way to see and teach! Thank you very much!!,5
4919,Really good ideas and good assignments.,5
4920,I'm quite happy with this course. Thank you MoMA and Coursera!,5
4921,It was a very interesting course! Well-structure and nice to attend! I learned a lot of new things and I also had some ideas for using Art and Inquiry in my classroom! Thank you MoMa,5
4922,"Great! this course gives amazing activities and ideas for the classroom, but it also gives you smart strategies for us to connect and evaluate a work of art differently.",5
4923,Amazing course!,5
4924,Great !!,5
4925,Good content,4
4926,"Some of the content are repetitive. The first interview sounds ""staged"". Some Korean reference (""noon sei"" or something like that ) are non-value adding.",2
4927,Great teacher!,5
4928,"I am quite new to this learning portal and thus visited just few courses. Nevertheless I didn´t finish all of them because some were unfortunately quite boring. In contrast this course is so far the best I have seen. Professor Chang caught my attention from the first second. Course is very well structured, lessons and language are easy to understand. Lecture is very interactive, interrupted by short questions to maintain your concentration. Background is changing in order to keep your attention and desire to know more. Learning with prof. Chang is simply great fun!!!",5
4929,It would be better if the course can include more examples,4
4930,Thank you! For very interesting Course!!!!,5
4931,Great Course to Start a business Career,5
4932,The lessons contain brief explanation even if this is an introduction study only. There are a lot of key things and terms to remember (that are mostly hard to comprehend if you do not have marketing knowledge) which I also believe are necessary in further B2B market study.PS. I like the funny introductions and side comments of Prof. Chang.,4
4933,love the lectures,5
4934,"The best course I have ever taken online! Great studying, quality nad quantity of materials...really enjoyed it. Since we do not have lessons on this topic ar the university and we get only basic palentology information so we can understand todays animals, this was a great way to deepen and upgrade the knowledge . Thanks!",5
4935,"Excellent course of current knowledge of Marine reptiles from Mesozoic age. Thanks for accept me as free student, best wishes.",5
4936,"I loved that there were discrete chunks of learning in this course. All to often one is bombarded with data and can't make any sense from it. But here each weekly segment was complete and at the end, everything fitted together.Thank you. In fact, I have enjoyed all the University of Alberta courses offered on reptiles, birds, dinosaurs, etc.",5
4937,"Wow, what a fantastic course. Well structured and very well presented by a very knowledgeable palaeontologist. I cannot recommend this course enough.",5
4938,Superbly presented course.Thank you *.*,5
4939,"I love this course! I have learned so much, and the quizzes are so nice and short. They don't give me time to stress!!!",5
4940,One of the best (maybe the best) courses. Thank you!,5
4941,"Wonderful ! I have not been know about ancient Marine Reptiles until today. So, I am really thank you to teach and give knowledge for me.",5
4942,"Absolutely phenomenal course! Would recommend a million times over to anyone interested in this subject. I'm even looking into applying to the UofA after going through their wonderful MOOC's, well run, and interesting, wonderful course notes to supplement the clean, information packed, video lessons. Loved the interactive material too! The interactive phylogenetic tree was a lifesaver, I spent hours on that thing just reading up and looking around.",5
4943,Absolutely brilliant course.,5
4944,"I've just finish this course and it is the last one for me in the series of the paleontology courses provided by University of Alberta. And I must say, I'm simply blown away by all these courses! The topics covered are absolutely fascinating, the material presentation exceeded all my expectations and Scott Persons, the presenter, is probably the most engaging teacher I've ever seen, absolutely perfect at holding attention and delivering the material.I liked the way the course is structured - individually following the evolutionary tree of all three major groups. It's really interesting to see how evolution worked out for them.The material itself isn't short of terminology so it's treats listeners seriously, providing nitty-gritty details of how the evolution process took place, I really appreciate that. And it's never overdone, so a person without a special knowledge background can go through course just fine. Although it won't hurt to start these courses with Dino 101 first :)Interactive materials are a very nice touch and a welcome addition to excellent videos and great lecture notes. Loved the use of fossils as well, it's a joy to get a look at some treasures a university like this has in their possession.Hopefully, the staff behind these courses will be able to find an opportunity and new topics to continue to share knowledge about that mesmerizing time of prehistoric life. Until then, many thanks to all of them!",5
4945,5 star course thank you,5
4946,The subtitles once not match with the avance of the video.,5
4947,"This is my second course through the University of Alberta. I did Dino 101 (which I highly recommend on its own or before the Paleontology series) and was so impressed. Ancient Marine Reptiles is extremely in-depth - there is A LOT to learn here, from various animals to evolution, classification and trees. The instructor is absolutely phenomenal! I love his teaching style: he kept me engaged, interested and learning with nearly every sentence. It is obvious that he loves the world of Paleontology and that makes him easy to learn from. I highly, highly recommend this course and any others from the University of Alberta - they are some of the best courses I've ever taken.",5
4948,"This was a most informative course. and for me. not an easy one by any means. For an under-graduate, I would say is essential. Well done! And thank you!",5
4949,"Can be extremely complicated with all of the unfamiliar names, and I'd lose focus. As a result, I had a hard time keeping up. I'd recommend pausing and returning another day if you lose focus.",4
4950,No frills honest conjecture. Presentation material ocassionally looses to the tech but great with a chance of hiccups.,5
4951,Splending. Awesome. Ivy league.,5
4952,"This is a fascinating journey into the evolution of ancient marine reptiles. if you're a fan of paleontology and ancient animal life like I am, this course is for you. It's really well done and you won't regret it.",5
4953,Yet another great course by the University of Alberta.,5
4954,"I love Paleontology! This is a fantastic course, which makes me love life.",5
4955,Wonderful and informative course! Thank you so much!,5
4956,great course! Fun and interesting,5
4957,Another great course from the University that brought you Dino101,5
4958,"Fantastic! I would love some more of this teaching approach on other animals groups! i.e. Pterosaurs, whales, etc.",5
4959,"I thought this would be a fun simple class, but I DID NOT know anything about marine reptiles, and it showed. I learned a lot and this instruction was very helpful and very educational.",5
4960,Interesting course,5
4961,"Wonderful... just love how much there's to learn. Love the exposition the data, how it was developed. The perfect timing of the sound and english subtitles.Excellent professor.I will enrol to more Paleontology courses",5
4962,"excellent course would love to see more on early crocodilians and turtles, I know turtles have a debated history but would be awesome to look at possible origins.",4
4963,superb presentations following the three major divisions of marine reptiles from their origins to their eventual extinctions,5
4964,Another excellent course from the University of Alberta. A real privilege to have the opportunity to learn in this way.,5
4965,Excellent presentation of the information. I definitely have a much greater appreciation of these marine reptiles,5
4966,"This is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic, but doesn't go into much depth. While it's clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material, I still would not recommend this course. Both the presentation itself and the in-video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious. The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to, and the in-video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time. Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities, which are badly designed and just frustrating. Overall, I recommend waiting for a better course.",2
4967,another brilliant piece of entertaining and informative education from Alberta.,5
4968,"just amazing i was looking for material in this are and had neverf ound , thanks alot =D",5
4969,"Again, wonderfully clear and informative.",5
4970,Another wonderful course from University of Alberta. Scott Persons is a great lecturer. Material is interesting and well structured.,5
4971,Great course! Just PLEASE don't use Dave Peters images on it.,5
4972,"Course is great. Coursera is a minus 5 stars for their money grubbing propensities. Love the instructor for these dinosaur courses, he is personable, knowledgeable and just a naturally great teacher. The information is fascinating and scientifically up to date. It leaves me with a favorable impression of the University of Alberta's research. The graphics used in all these courses are simply beautiful.",5
4973,Excellent course. Lots of information presented very well.,5
4974,The course was very detailed and complete. I learned a lot. It was a very good course.,5
4975,"An excellent introduction to the sometimes overlooked marine predators that lived alongside the dinosaurs! A lot of detail is presented here, so be prepared to act like a sponge and soak it all up.",5
4976,very well organised and stimulatingly presented .a whole new world is unfolded for the student.,5
4977,"I appreciate all staff of UNA and Coursera. I have been passed good study 4 weeks. So I did average 10 hours study in a day , 3 days in a week. It was hard for me but enjoyed.I passed 3 week quiz full point but final one was 1 quiz lost.Please let me know how to know which quiz was incorrect. And can I try second attempt it?",5
4978,"A very interesting course, but it's a pity one can only do the quizzes after payment.",4
4979,It would be great if even the auditing students cool take the quizzes.,4
4980,"Excelent course. I did not know nothing about the incredible fossil record that this ancient reptiles have, now I am learning a lot about its origin and evolution.",5
4981,"An excellent course on a fascinating subject, provided by an engaged team of professional and knowledgeable palaeontologists from the University of Alberta. I greatly enjoyed the video lectures, interactive tools and puzzles, discussions, detailed course notes, and just generally being able to take part in this wonderful course! Thanks for making this possible!",5
4982,Very interesting and meaningful. I personally recomend it.,5
4983,Very nice course. Well prepared and a lot of information to keep the interest alive in Paleontology.,5
4984,Nice course. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks so much.,5
4985,"As usual for UofA Palaeo courses, 5 out of 5.",5
4986,Fascinating course! learned a lot.,5
4987,This is a great course,5
4988,Great course. Would definitely recommend it.,5
4989,Very well instructed and the videos are nice and short. Perfect as a side project or on the go learning.,4
4990,Very good course. Explanations of new technology andbasic concepts were informative and easy to understand.,5
4991,I love this course. Easy explaining so it's easy to understand.,5
4992,A very interesting course for beginners and a very good first step in pursuing deeper knowledge. Thank you Edinburgh University and Coursera,5
4993,Really interesting material and well presented in digestible chunks by a pair of engaging professionals in the field.,4
4994,Many thanx for a fantastic course! Waiting for your next one!,5
4995,Amazing course! Brings me a lot of updated information regarding technic that how mesure an observe the universe currently,5
4996,I enjoyed a lot this course and even if I am doing astrophysics I have learned some technical details!!,5
4997,Fantastic course for a beginner like me with no prior knowledge about Astronomy. Gives you loads of information about different elements of the universe with good details around how technology integrates with all the different elements to help us understand the overall picture better and be able to predict and past and future of our ever expanding universe. I am very glad I took this course.,5
4998,"The course was well planned, thorough and organized.",5
4999,Great course for learning not only the way the universe work but also the way we have learned it!,5
5000,Enjoyed this a lot. Wish I'd kept to my childhood plans to become an astronomer.,5
5001,Provides new insights for Dark Energy and Dark Matter and also helps one understand the basic Physics as applied to Astronomy.Really nice course !,5
5002,great starter for astronomy and cosmology :),5
5003,Excellent initial overview course for people without a knowledge of the Arctic or Environmental Science.,5
5004,The content was good and very instructive but the videos and graphic material could be more dynamic and interactive.,4
5005,Very interesting,5
5006,"Nice overview, gives a good appreciation for changes happening in the Arctic. Sometimes the lecture material is a bit dry and repetitive/slow.",4
5007,"The class isn't over but I'm suffering through it, not enjoying it, like I did the dino Uof A classes. Problems: the presenter is HORRIBLE. He's sing-songy, trying to be interesting. Can't you get the dino guy? Or me -I'll do it for free. PAINFUL. Also - you need more graphics. Charging along with Mr. Boring and a map of Alaska behind him as concept after concept - difficult ones for folks who aren't like me with lots of background - is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension. Even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing. Yes, I noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the ""sun at an angle around the sun"" graphic but who cares? It's something. And yes, I know it's free, and I know you have budgets, but 3 universities can't rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship?? The content is probably better than my perception - and I'm perceiving high! - because I need an aspirin after 20 minutes of Mr. Please Get A Professional Presenter [or at least competent.] I create online education that is nothing better than Powerpoint and a talking head, lack of budget, but at least the head doesn't make people want to drown themselves in a melting glacier.",2
5008,"The course content was very interesting, however, the way it was presented was very dull and monotonous. The script was great - very insightful and informative, but having the presenter talk for the whole lecture without more frequent use of diagrams, figures, etc. to help understand the concepts is not helpful and incomprehensible to me. Specially when it comes to a course with so much geographical content, it would be good to have a more consistent depiction of maps. Furthermore, with all the new concepts, visual aid would help students understand what things are and what they look like since the backgrounds chosen for the lectures have little or nothing to do with the course whatsoever.On the other hand, I do think that the questions throughout the videos are extremely useful as they (usually) tackle problems that were not mentioned previously and gets the student to think independently. Finally, the end of lesson tests always have one or two challenging questions which is great. This course has a 5 star potential, so I hope the reviews are being read so they can work towards that goal!",3
5009,"I was really excited about this course. I thought the information was of high quality and well presented. However, I did have trouble staying focused. I would have liked more graphics depicting concepts. The presenter had a very monotone voice with a very active face. It was hard to sit through someone just talking at me even if the subject matter is interesting. I look forward to the other Arctic courses and hope they are just are well thought out but a bit more lively. You guys did a great job, keep it up!",4
5010,Great! I love the fact that it is a very simple course and information is easy to understand! I also adore the professionalism that is present in every lecture. Absolutely fantastic!,5
5011,A very good review of the main topics related to the Arctic and climate change. Final lesson tests are sometimes confusing.,4
5012,"Great course, very didactic and a easy way to learn about the Artic.",5
5013,very thought provoking,5
5014,"Very good, very Canadian.",5
5015,"Very interesting course on the Arctic. As an introduction, I appreciated the broad overview of the things affecting the Arctic and thus the global climate. As a neophyte, some of the more technical, scientific aspects were hard to follow but were just as interesting to understand; having the course notes to go back to was helpful!",4
5016,"I found the course informative, but the quizzes to be a problem as there were too many multiple answers, so was near impossible to complete the quizzes correctly",4
5017,Very interesting course that covers the the Arctic and how it has been impacted by climate change. Overall a qualitative discussion of the Arctic climate that references more detailed quantitative data. The summary sheets for each week are a really helpful reference for the class and beyond.,4
5018,"Content was very good. I didn't liked the assignments, they were too short and the answering options were too narrow; sometimes they could be misinterpreted and led to a confusing missing point. I would recommend to add several more questions for each assignment, chosen random for each attempt, put a limit on total attempts and give feedback on answers. Thanks for the course, I enjoyed it a lot; short but precise.",4
5019,"Interesting subject, the presenter is hard to listen to though.",2
5020,"really interesting, it's a really good base for all to understand the Arctic and a rebound to understand the climat change. I would like to learn more in the pdf lesson, if you'll be able to add some optional lessons to read I would appreciate, but for sur I'll take the next course. It well structure and explain. The other thing is about the test it will be interesting to have all the good answer after we've pass it. Just to understand our mistake",4
5021,"An interesting, very well instructed MOOC! Very good lectures and excellent scripts. I also liked the many questions/quizzes that were embedded in the video lectures. If another MOOC was offered by the instructor, I would take it.",5
5022,"Good info. Instructor had rather odd body language, but friendly. Had trouble passing a couple of section tests due to ""check all that apply"" questions. Sections on ocean and atmosphere circulation and global warming rather boring and a little harder to follow. Interesting class overall.",4
5023,"nice course, well taught, with interesting information",5
5024,Very nicely put together and presented into a down to earth course about the Arctic and how climate change is affecting all species of life in the surrounding area.,5
5025,"The course is good but it could be improved. For example, I don't think the images on the background (even if they are stunning) are particularly important and I think they could be substituted by plots and schemes referring to the topics (all the presented schemes where helpful, but there would have been more things that would have been good to see visually).",2
5026,There is a very technical portion to this class making it difficult for the neophyte to truly understand and explain course content.,3
5027,Cool,4
5028,It is an exremely useful course for both the Swedish language and a better academic writing! I would like to ask Lund University to share more courses with us=),5
5029,Best course ever i have completed in my life :),5
5030,Very easy to comprehend course. Both presenters put extra effort in relaying the material and introducing comical relief along the way. I can say now that I understand more above z-scores and t-scores that I ever did at university! I would highly recommend the course for anyone feeling a bit scared than facing statistical information,5
5031,These guys use the best examples to make statistics fun!,5
5032,Very good course and very interesting.,5
5033,Is the most beautiful course ever I learned stats by taking this course.,5
5034,I had a really great time with the material! Thank you!,5
5035,"I am new to statistics and found most of the lessons difficult to understand, although I did pass the course and had taken the first two courses of the specialization before. More exercises would help. Also I do not plan on using R in the future so this part of the course was not very relevant to me, but it was not the hardest.",3
5036,Thank you! It is so amazing!,5
5037,"Engaging video lectures that are just the right length, and a great R lab that is super helpful, I highly recommend this course!",5
5038,Very good course to get started in statistics,5
5039,"I had a really great time with this course. A lot of work went into it, from the presentation to the content. Really well done. It was quite challenging. I felt that the last module (7) introduced some very difficult concepts which, even after checking other sources, I couldn't understand fully. Some questions from the exam in that module were substantially different from the ones in the lectures. I would give 4.5 stars if I could.",4
5040,Great course for beginners:S,5
5041,"The course has fun illustrations and a high quality of production, but the lessons themselves don't dive very deep. Ideas are introduced but not considered in depth. One such example is variance. We get the equations but not much insight into what it is a measure of and it's value. Additionally, and this might just be me, but the experiments used to illustrate examples at times are difficult to understand.",3
5042,Thank you very much for this great course!,5
5043,Was a useful course for people wanting to learn statistical concepts!,4
5044,Thanks for making things simpler.,5
5045,"Course material is not enough, you need to also refer at least one reference book as well.",3
5046,I have to say this course has the best picture/graphical illustration than any course that I have ever taken. nice job UvA!!!,5
5047,very useful for BA psychology students!,5
5048,Good course on basic statistics.,5
5049,"its very interesting course , its gave me insight about statistics which i did not have knowledge about it before .",5
5050,thank you,4
5051,"Great course, useful and fun",5
5052,Nice and well done. Teachers are very clear in explaining concepts and examples are useful and helpful.,4
5053,Fantastic course. Best in the world,5
5054,The course helped me to check my knowledge from basic statistics. Teachers are great and explain difficult topics on some easy to understand examples. Thank you!,5
5055,"Very helpful for beginners, the examples are very well chosen to help you understand the meaning of all the mathematical formulas.",4
5056,it was truly helpful! thank you guys!,5
5057,Thank you very much for this course! I got many useful information and had lots of fun to study it.,5
5058,This course is a very interesting course. It introduces the world of statistics. It is a good start.,5
5059,"The lecturers are very engaging and clearly experts in the field. The concepts are explained and illustrated beautifully, with lots of examples.",5
5060,"It's awesome! I've never had such a more cool lecture. Thanks, Profs. I'll take other classes!",5
5061,"great introduction to statistics with no prior knowledge required. Although in parts has been challenging, for me is the right degree of difficulty to push an individual to learning.",5
5062,Beautiful Teaching.. Well done,5
5063,Great introduction to statistics presented in a very interesting and engaging way.,4
5064,It's everything I needed to keep running with Data Scientist Specialization preparing.Thank you so much for your support!,4
5065,"I've first time attended an online course. Basic statistic is great for specialization both students and employers. Syllabus of lessons become simple to complex, so it get easier learning. 1st week of the course about to finish. Thanks for all.",5
5066,very good course,5
5067,"Very good prepared, congratulations. The course helped me understand the basic notions very easily and with fun.",5
5068,It was a very useful courser. I really enjoyed it and learnt a lot. Thank you.,5
5069,Great course! very intuitive. Great learning experience.,5
5070,"Outstanding courses, may be the best one that I ever seen on Coursera.org!Thank you!",5
5071,"Whenever I read and try to understanding about statistic, I feel it's very difficult and confusing. But with the simple method of this video to teach me about statistic, now I feel that my love parameter about statistic is increased. Thank you very much.",5
5072,"Way too much videos and too little hands-on learning. Felt like the course mostly taught you to remember stuff, and not actually learning a skill, though I broke the course early.",1
5073,"very clear and well-organized, one of my best experiences on coursera",5
5074,Very nice and easy presentations describing things I forgot from university.,5
5075,"This course is very well prepared, thanks to the video and the commitments of the 2 teachers,There is also a good balance between Theory and Practice (usage of R).I do already use the learning of this course in my daily job (data & analytics)Good job and thank you to the entire team who has prepared this course.",5
5076,"FUN, surprisingly!",5
5077,The course was great! It was quite dense and took a lot of time especially the R Lab sessions. Mr Loon may like to use more interesting ways for communication. Also the transcripts provided do not contain equations/ formulas which becomes a problem. Integrating slides into transcripts would be helpful.,4
5078,Very good to refresh your statistics skills.,5
5079,Easy and inspiring,5
5080,"I liked the course, nonetheless I liked we had previous exercises to prepare to each evaluation.",4
5081,"I've only gotten started, but there seems some assumptions made about how much we know and how quickly we can pick up these new terms and ideas.",2
5082,"Very clear, very good visuals, easy to follow. Highly recommended. I only wished the DataCamp examples were in Python, not R, but I understand R is a more natural choice for non-programmers. The lab and the presented theory are well synced.",5
5083,For people who want to enter the world of statistics...this is the course.PERIOD!,5
5084,"Great course!Well explained concepts, easy to grasp, thorough evaluation :)",5
5085,"I liked the content of the course very much; the videos were all very clear, with nice examples & visualisations of those examples. However, the R labs included in this course were not very challenging; by following a list of steps you can complete them easily without learning much from them. Additionally, the R labs sometimes would not accept an answer as correct when it was a slightly different solution to the same problem.",4
5086,"Overall, very good course. I thought the weakest sections were the ones taught by Prof. Emiel van Loon (the dark-haired one). I found him much less clear and engaging than Prof. Matthijs Roduijn (the blonde one). The R labs were fine for me because I have a background in programming, but people without that may need a lot of time to do them.",4
5087,This course covers the basic knowledge of statistics and probability but skips the mathematical details behind the theory. Great for beginners but not perfect for advanced users.,4
5088,Excellent course.The final exam was awesome.Very demanding and exciting course,5
5089,"I love this course, it is perfect for statistics beginner. The lecturer are talking in a interesting way, I won't feel boring.",5
5090,The course is quite informative and educative for a non-statistical person like me. The instructors were explaining complex concepts in a very simpler manner. Except that the use of data camp for R could have been replaced with the exercises done on R (offline) and submitted through the quiz. The quizzes were really good.,4
5091,Highly recomended!!!!,5
5092,Great course but a lack of formulas in pdf files is very uncomfortable,5
5093,2 Stars less because they should have included R video tutorials,3
5094,"Very engaging videos, good pace, easy to understand. Great job guys!",5
5095,"Love the lectures and the way everything is organized in the course, however the information or instructions provided by the labs seem incomplete.",4
5096,"Not very helpful. In the homework I spent more time wrestling with commands in R than actually gaining an understanding of the subject matter.Also, I really didn't need so many subject matter examples about the professor's baby's pooping habits. (And my family is Dutch with all the offensive humor that comes with it, so it's not just a matter of the sense of humor not translating)I'm re-taking Statistics with Calculus online at my local state university and frankly, I can't notice any benefit from taking this course first. My current online Statistics with Calculus course is rewarding and I feel like I'm truly gaining mastery of the topics, whereas in the Basic Statistics course I was floundering.The graphics in the way the lessons are presented are well done! But I would have been just fine with fewer graphics if it meant more worked-through examples.",2
5097,Fantastic !! Very condensed and well explained,5
5098,"Good design and really easy to learn, good teachers even for beginners",5
5099,It was a great course and method of teaching was exceptional.,5
5100,The illustrations and the teaching methodologies employed are way beyond what words can explain. A big Thanks to all of you!,5
5101,"Simple, Concise and Awesome",5
5102,Thank you very much for your insightful explanation on statistics. I am much more of a picture person and the approach of this course has a very huge impact on my job and study. I hope you will have this kind of new courses in the future. I am willing to follow your courses in the future.,5
5103,Contents are very well explained,5
5104,"Though it was mentioned that this course is for beginners without too much of statistics background, I still feel, some decent background is required to take up this course, particularly the Inference part.Otherwise, the course is pretty good and commendable.",4
5105,Absolutely amazing course with good humour and great pictures. You will get knowledge of Basics of Statistics which will stay with you for a long time after passing an exam.,5
5106,There should be some case study to feel real time scenario. As far as the content is concern its perfect.Thanks,4
5107,"Excellent course, virtually all the lectures were taught based on practical examples, exactly the way statistics should be taught. 10 out of 10, no shadow of a doubt",5
5108,This course is awesome :),5
5109,"Great content, very useful and practical (applicable to nearly everything you ork with) and presented in a very interesting way. The Graphics are genious",5
5110,"As a student of the UvA I have followed multiple courses on statistics as the university, and this coursera course comes very close to the level of those courses. (For free!)",5
5111,"I have already given my feed back. Excellent. No words other than thanks, thanks, thanks to all who made me learn the basic statistics from your well learned team.",5
5112,The lecturer does not clearly explain the topics very well especially on the topics in Probability and Distribution. His presentation in English is honestly quite hard to understand.,2
5113,It's a great introductory course to statistics.,5
5114,"A really great course. Simple to follow and understand, but provides insights into the basics of statistics. Almost no math which is good news for non-experts and makes the course more accessible for a broader audience. The lecturers explain the intuition behind the fundamental things in statistics, which I find very important before studying the statistical tests (inferential statistics). Feels like it opened my eyes.Thank you very much Matthijs Rooduijn and Emiel van Loon!",5
5115,What an amazing course!!! This is a very important step for me to enter data science,5
5116,The animation is pretty great!,5
5117,"I have started this course again and again. Although the lectures themselves are clear enough, the quizzes are sometime so confusing and don't reflect the way that topic was taught. The worst part is R lab. I understand nothing of it. It makes no sense. I should not be part of a basic statistics course. I have wasted my money on a specialization that I can't get because I will not, and simply cannot learn R. They should have made that clear this would involve programming. I am only now thinking of learning from the videos but have given up the hope of getting a specialization certificate.The instructor in the first two session was still engaging, but starting in the third lesson the instructor is so boring and his voice makes me drowsy. Plus his sentences are so long and confusing. He has a horrible way to explain something. They need to keep in mind this is BASIC statistics, so cut down on the jargon. He does introduce the terms in 3.01 but just after one video the words don't magically sit in my memory.I've given 3 stars because although I have to work double hard just to make sense of what the instructor says by reading a book on basic statistics, at least the videos provide a structure, good examples and after watching them a few times things become clear.",3
5118,Interesting course to refresh my basics in statistics. Professors are engaged and uses simple example to present the concepts.,5
5119,"I loved the course. The clear explanations, tough quizzes and cheerful attitude helped me invest and find joy in statistics. Now I want to learn more and more.",5
5120,Really a good course. Worth learning.,5
5121,The explanations in the videos were very helpful. A very useful course.,4
5122,I recommend this course.,5
5123,This is a brilliant course to learn statistics from scratch. The instructors are too good and their teaching methods and examples are very lucid. A must visit course for everyone who wants to get their statistics correct,5
5124,great way to teach,5
5125,Thank you very much! I learned so much!,5
5126,I use this course to better understand a statistic course I am following for my Psychology studies. Many thanks for the crystal clear explanations!,5
5127,This course is one of the best I wish every students at university for BA or MS or PHD learn Statistics I think we need it in all kind of business life,5
5128,Its Awesome experience,5
5129,Best course for the beginners in Statistics.,5
5130,"Very good class for beginners, everything is well explained and illustrated with examples. I highly recommend this course for those who want to understand statistics easily",5
5131,"A very engaging approach to online teaching, that is very effective at keeping you from zoning out while staring at boring slides of text with someone speaking over top of it. I wish more online learning courses would follow this example.",5
5132,R labs are too tedious for people with medical or science background! we need explanations rather than trying to figure it out on our own!,2
5133,"The ""basic statistics"" is an excellent course. The course is detail-oriented, very useful and easily understood. I strongly recommend it.",5
5134,"I am almost done with this course and I want to recommend it very highly. I came to this with a lapsed and sporadic understanding of probability and statistics. I followed all the lectures, did all the tests and homeworks and feel like I have learned a lot.",5
5135,"I sucked at math in high school, but this course is making me love math again. Excellent job, Amsterdam Uni.",5
5136,"Good course, although sometimes instructions/questions are unclear",4
5137,this course was a waste of my time; luckily I found out after wasting only 6 hours on the preview. this course apparently requires a level of probability knowledge I don't,1
5138,"One of the best courses of statistics for the beginners. The concepts are well explained, the learning path well researched and above everything the R labs were ideal for the beginners.",5
5139,Very useful Statistics Course.,4
5140,It is absolutely a great course!,5
5141,The supervisor and the content is extremely good.,5
5142,Excellent instructors; lessons are well structured.,5
5143,"Excellent course, clear informative lectures using real life examples that make statistics easier to understand.",5
5144,"it is very useful for learning basic satistics. really awsome,you won't regret to choose it.",5
5145,"Intuitive, clear, neither too fast nor too slow.. easy to follow",5
5146,"great intro class to statistics. Love the animation, teaching style and R lab exercises. The first class in coursera that video content and quiz are relevant. Highly recommended!!!",5
5147,"The case studies and explanations are very clear, and the visuals really work to help understand the material. I strongly recommend the course.",5
5148,"I hadn't touched math in any real way in years and this was a great re-introduction. The videos were fun and engaging, and while the material was challenging, I felt I got a lot out of it. I highly recommend it for people who need statistics for their work or for a degree program but who are feeling a little intimidated by it.As far as feedback goes, I would have liked to get explanations for quiz questions I couldn't answer. I wish there was a way to say, ""This is the quiz score I'd like to accept; now please explain to me the ones I missed."" The lack of feedback on the quizzes was frustrating at times.",5
5149,The best course I've ever enrolled in.,5
5150,Brilliant formulated course with ample examples which makes the course really interesting! Recommended for first timers as well as refreshers!,5
5151,Great course :),4
5152,Uses R with no explanation. Why does it use a challenging programming language that is not the point. The point is to learn statistics.Use Statcrunch - so students can focus on statistics not programming,1
5153,Teachers have very clear logic to teach and make things very easy to understand.,5
5154,"Excellent MOOC. A great introduction to the basic elements of statistics. I had studied statistics years ago in my bachelor but almost forgot everything. This course greatly helped me revive all the elementary concepts. The teachers explain complex things in simple terms easy to follow, and the funny examples have brought a smile to my face more than once and twice during the MOOC. Finally, the collaboration with professional illustrators adds great value to the course. A big deal of effort has gone into its making, and it truly pays off. I just wished there'd be an intermediate and advanced statistics course to keep digging into it!Thanks a lot!Alejandro",5
5155,"I was always scared of Statistics but after going through this training, Statistics has been made simple and I am enjoying it. I have decided to pursue more Statistics training from the University of Amsterdam on Coursera. I enjoyed the training of those great faculty members.",5
5156,"It is really helpful to get an idea for statisctics. Examples, quizzes, assignments as well as R lab designed on according to content of class. There is no suprise.",5
5157,Nice. For noobs.I enjoyed it!,4
5158,It's an excellent course. All the content is simple and easy to follow.Congratulations for such a great didactic.,5
5159,"Really a great introductory course. I am a real beginner in statistics, since I need it to make it easier for my self at data mining and machine learning in the future, this course gives me a solid basic understanding of terminology, calculations and relationships between calculations. Week 3 and 4 are pretty hard in my opinion, but after doing the course learning how to learn I know how to handle it, so I will recommend everybody to do that one also if you think this looks too difficult for you.",5
5160,Excellent presentation of concepts!!,5
5161,Great Presentation !,5
5162,Thank you!,5
5163,Fantastic Instructors. Imparting complex concepts using simple examples is commendable. Thumbs up!,5
5164,"It's a great course to learn basic statistics.The course structure is clear and well ordered, and the video lectures are friendly and well explained.I'm pleased with the course.Thanks people",5
5165,Excellent jobs in explaining sophisticated theories with vivid examples ^^,5
5166,Great course! Finally I could learn statistics and R,5
5167,Easy to follow and information was presented beautifully. Was very enjoyable learning experience.,5
5168,"I am a physician... love this course. Highly recommend it. Even if you don't complete the tests, it is extremely useful to all physicians, residents and medical professionals and to anyone who wants to know statistics.",5
5169,I am really enjoying all the courses on Statistics. Thank you to the whole team.,5
5170,"Very nice and useful course, some small mistakes in R assignments",4
5171,very nice course,5
5172,The course is very well done and explained in a very simple way!,5
5173,"The course is really good.i was little bit familiar with statistics but after this course everything became clear in my mind and don,t have any confusion also .",4
5174,"I really liked the course, it was relatively easy to understand and enjoyable, and specially the lessons taught by Matthijs, he was just amazing at making it all very understandable and enjoyable. And overall, I just really feel some exercises along the way for each topic would have been of great help.",4
5175,Amazing teaching for wonderful subject.,5
5176,IT is simply the best course i have seen here !Well done !! It would be great to see some other courses like this! A big + to Universty of Amsterdam!,5
5177,Very clearly presented and easy to understand. The course explains what the calculations mean.,5
5178,Excellent course and well taught by both instructors. 4 stars because of the lack of feedback on quizzes and exam.,4
5179,The concepts are explained very clearly. Thanks to the team.,5
5180,"Lovely accent, great lecture for the younger teacher. The older teacher really confuses me sometimes cos the language he used was very academic and hard to understand, besides he has a tendency to read other than lecture",4
5181,"Very useful and ineresting course, Demonestration diagrams in the videos are very clear and delivering the information easily, like it, ma",5
5182,Nice and challenging (despite the fact that most of the material was taught at school many years ago...),5
5183,"Very well done: a lot of effort put into this course, and it pays off.",5
5184,"Excellent, clear to-the-point explanations supported by matching graphics and pace. About the best course I've taken so far.",5
5185,"Great class, but I wish there were more practice problems. Statistics is a very important concept to learn for any field, and I highly recommend this class.",4
5186,The best introduction to Statistics.,5
5187,It was a great and nice course. I remembered a lot o things and I knew some key concepts and approaches to learn. Thank you.,5
5188,This course was awesome.,5
5189,"Great and clear videos, they make it very easy to understand all the concepts even if you don't know anything about the topic. The R-lab assignments are a great tool for getting usedt to working with what you have learned.",5
5190,This is a nice course...thanks for providing such a great content from University of Amserdam.Please allow us to complete the course as I have to wait till the session starts for week 2 lessions.,5
5191,"It's a very good course to start learning statistics! I love instructors, they are so funny!",5
5192,Well structured course with engaging examples. I found the tests really helped me practice and learn the material. I will certainly take other courses in this specialization.,5
5193,"The course is as much about computer programming as it is about statistics. The statistics I can do with pen and paper; the programming, I found very, very unhelpful and confusing. Eventually, I gave up on the course.",1
5194,I would give five stars BUTI wish that it isn't a must to finish R program.,4
5195,"This is a great course. It was challenging but not discouraging. I think that there is a high probability that I learned something very useful. Now that I have said the most important words now I would like to give a thumbs down on the Data Camp R section. I found it to be frustrating and discouraging. You can find better information and tutorials on YouTube. Check out""MarinStatsLectures. A text book is also a great help. I bought Elementary Statistics at a used book store for $4.00 US. And it correlated very nicely with the course. If you are interested in statistics this course is a good first step.",5
5196,"easy, useful",5
5197,"Very well paced, adn clearly explained. Transcripts are good though note you'll need to annotate them with the equations discussed.",5
5198,Excellent course. Very well structured. Videos are excellent and explanations are very clear.,5
5199,"The instructors are awesome to convey the concepts using examples. They actually made learning statistics to be fun which is unexpected and unseen elsewhere (e.g. Universities, other stats courses). I have been enjoying myself in learning. Thank you!",5
5200,Very illustrative relatable examples taken to explain in this course which indeed covering most of the concepts in the field of Statistics. Totally found the course very likeable and matching the expectations I had in mind.,5
5201,Great!,5
5202,I enjoyed the class.,4
5203,Most Precise Course with lots of excersices,5
5204,some of the videos were outstanding and easy to understand. Need more handholding for understanding of concepts and review/explanation of the quiz results will reinforce learning further.,3
5205,"I can say, the best course I took online.",5
5206,These concpets are explained in a clear and simple methods. Thats helpful to me.Thanks,5
5207,"Excellent, it is going to clear all my basics. Regards",5
5208,"Easy and Clear, I wish I could find this course a year earlier.",5
5209,"This course has given me a much better understanding of many concepts I never understood while studying at university - Like the sampling distribution etc. and I can recommend it...The only ""but"" is... I can see from the discussions that some (many?) students have problems with the ""R"" assignments. I have been programming previously, so I have not have had these problems. I would though like that these ""R"" assignments where easier to print or collect in a PDF document, so that I could easily use it as a ""howto"" later.",4
5210,"Good course, but it seems there are some errors in the quiz and labs",4
5211,"Simple explanations that make the topic rather easy to learn and having a visual aid (the drawings) I find it to be so much more friendly that I've really come to enjoy what I'm learning (I'm mostly a visual learner so to me this is very good). So far it has been a great course with R labs that can help reinforce the ideas and give a bit more practice in the subject, I do recommend the course.",5
5212,I really enjoyed attending this course and recommended it to my colleagues and friends who want to learn basic statistics. They have tried their best to make it more intuitive with some interesting examples and make the learning somewhat fun. kudos to the entire team!,4
5213,I always dreaded Statistics. This course made me really understand the basics of statistics. Well explained and good examples.Thanks,5
5214,Great explanation with real world examples! My basics of probability and inferential statistics are rock solid now!,5
5215,Makes you thinking.,5
5216,Useful and help,5
5217,Basic intro to Stats & R. Very good if you are starting either / both.,5
5218,Hey its really fun to learn statistics this way. Great Job!,5
5219,Very helpful in understanding foundation of stats or Theory of Probability.All tutors were very effective in delivery of content even if you do not know stats.,5
5220,"Very basic material for statistics, exposed with humor! Thank you for this great course!",5
5221,Some of the concepts are very clearly explained. Loved it,5
5222,Awesome Course for Beginners in Statistics as they clear examples for whatever they are teaching us. I love Coursera.,5
5223,I have tried other statistic courses before but this is by far my favorite! Excellent lecturer who offers clear examples.,5
5224,"Warm congratulations to the Team for putting together a statistics course that will not scare 90% of the course participants from day one. Well paced, well explained, nice humorous cases and step-by-step explanations. WELL DONE",5
5225,"Despite some error in the quizzes I learned quite a lot by taking this online course. Apparently the course organisers are overwhelmed by its success, since they react (too) slowly to comments made by students in the discussion fora. At least, errors should be tackled immediately.",4
5226,easy to understand.,5
5227,Most of the parts were interesting and clear... some cumbersome and slow pace with the other professor. Not sure if the diapers and shit-painting were the best examples.,4
5228,"Well recorded video, clear and kind explanation, and interesting.",5
5229,"Very good course, the explanations are made very accessible through understandable and sometimes funny examples.Learned many of new things, despite having finished a course on statistics in my university. Especially the R component helped me greatly; despite already having some experience, the datacamp modules were very helpful.Oh, and great Dutch accents :)",5
5230,"I am at the third week, that is very well explained. Sometimes I may need to watch the video again, but in general I am very satisfied. I think it could be good both for people who want to learn and people who want to review.",5
5231,Good course to polish up your statistics knowledge.,4
5232,great course,5
5233,High quality course for absolute beginners in stats. I highly recommend.,5
5234,This course is really awesome. Designed well. Looks like a lot of efforts have been taken by the team to build this course. Kudos to everyone. Keep up the good work and thank you very much.,5
5235,Very nicely created. Gets a bit too fast paced in the middle but still well worth taking this course.,5
5236,Very good introductory course to statistics and probability. This course is both entertaining and rigorous. I recommend this course without any hesitation to beginners and people who want to refresh their knowledge and skills in basic statistics.,5
5237,"I never thought I would learn so much so quickly in a math course. The course moves fast, but being able to rewind the videos and repeat anything I don't understand is really helpful! I love the applicability of what I'm learning, and my ability to take notes and practice everything on the quizzes makes the information stick.",5
5238,"The cartoons and animations used in this course really make statistics a lot easier and interesting. However few modules especially the later part of probability do not explain the concepts thoroughly. However, this is a great place to start!Also, the addition of R exercises are a great idea",3
5239,Best course I ever took so far! (out of 6 others),5
5240,"This is a very informative and good course for beginners who wants to explore basic statistics along with R lab. Ofcourse, I felt little tought when i tried to do R lab but finally got it!! Overall course was very informative and would definitely recoment for those who wants to learn statisticsthanks for professors and the team of University of Amsterdam for conducting this course.",5
5241,I like these two lecturers!,5
5242,"Five stars without any doubts.Useful and exciting learning experience, as for me.Thanks to the Instructional Team!",5
5243,"Overall, a great course that provides the basics of statistics in a thorough and intuitive way, plus a taste and feel of the software R. Of special note are the amazing visualizations in the presentations! There are some typoes and errors in the course material though, which is a shame, as everything else is excellent.",4
5244,Great course! very easy & funny examples,5
5245,"In my opinion this course is a good way to learn basic statistics. I do think the R part and the statistics part could be more integrated in order to learn R better and to use it more efficiently. For me the studytime was double the time that was stated even though I was already familiar with some of the concepts and calculations. I feel like some weeks the subjects should have gotten a little more explanation with video's or other supportive material, maybe some assigments to make in order to check wether you know and understand the material. Maybe you could compare content and way of teaching to the Duke University statistics course, this is not a better course per se but does do some things differently whilst both teaching stats and R.",4
5246,"Awesome course, very friendly to people who want to start learning R and practicing it straight away!",5
5247,"I've always had a rough time with mathematics, but the way this course is structured makes it easy for me to go at my own pace, re-watch videos that were confusing the first time through and work through problems until I really felt like I understand how the formulas work. The consistent use of exercises in R were extremely useful as well. I'd highly recommend this course and learning system for people like me, who never thought they'd be able to grasp mathematics.",5
5248,Very well-taught and complete statistics course !,5
5249,"Great watching all this numbers telling you information about people, though my numbers were slightly different sometimes. Thank you",5
5250,"Very dynamic and enjoyable class, great instructors and combination of theory and hands-on exercises.",5
5251,"Great course, highly recommended",5
5252,Course is really well made foe beginners in statistics. This is relevant.,4
5253,"So far a very nice course, well explained and clear enough to be followed even by non mathematicians. Well done!",4
5254,"I loved it very much. Easy to understand, visual and enjoyable explanations.",5
5255,"Clear, simple but engaging.The three lessons about R have been a fun.I'm looking forward to start the next session.",5
5256,This is best course on statistics.. at least for me who is comparatively new to it. I recommend it 100%.,5
5257,I like the course very much so far. The pacing is excellent and the material is very well adjusted to learners without much previous knowledge of the field.,5
5258,"Good to get the intuition behind the theory, but it is a high level course.",4
5259,It's wonderful how teacher have broken down each and every concept. Examples helps in clearing the concept well.,4
5260,"Both of the lecturers as well as the staff are excellent in making the learning simple, exciting and interesting. I have learned so much about statistics in so short a time with effectiveness and efficiency. Thanks for the excellent work. And all of you have made University of Amsterdam proud and stand tall.",5
5261,"Good course, nice illustrations that really support the course!",5
5262,"Good course for someone with background of statistics. The instructors are lucid but cover a lot in 7 weeks, they delve into intuitive insights of statistics. It is advisable to keep a textbook handy while undergoing this course. In the end good job University of Amsterdam!",5
5263,"Puerile, made up examples with made up data, no deeper treatment of the mathematics involved than the here-is-a-magic-formula-use-it approach and mistakes (including serious conceptual and factual errors) evident in the quizzes and the R labs. Far better to look out for the ""Data Analysis and Statistical Inference"" course by Duke on Coursera that is presented by a passionate statistics teacher, covers the same material (and more) and provides a far better introduction to R than this course.One of the stated purposes of this specialization is to clean up the way social scientists conduct science and are perceived as scientists; in this respect, it appears that the worst enemies of social scientists are social scientists.",1
5264,its carried out in excellent way.,5
5265,Very good explainations with plenty of examples,4
5266,great teaching on the subject! Thank you!,5
5267,"Absolutely great start for statistics with R. Not too heavy in time, not too light. Amazingly curated course.",5
5268,"This course is very beneficial to me.It explains the theory very clearly and lively that we can easily learn the concepts.Beside, R-lab helps me about the R language. This is very important.",5
5269,Inspiring course.,5
5270,"I love the main lecture of the statistics. The Subject is fun. After couple lecture, my mind was very clear.But most of the time I'm working on the statistics software name R. I think it would be better if require R knowledge. If not, student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R. I don't mean learn another software is bad idea. I will always like to learn something new. That's why I go MOOC. What I mean is R and Basic Statistics should be separated. First R, than Basic Statistic. Or first Basic Statistic than R.I really enjoy the class. but the extra is a bit heavy for me.",1
5271,"Great presentation, easy to understand with good examples. Way to go",5
5272,"This course is an excellent, comprehensive, introduction to Stats. It is challenging, but in a very good way. Expectations are set sufficiently high that you need to grasp the concepts to succeed. Excellent MOOC!!",5
5273,It is very helpfull .,5
5274,"Magnific course, excellent professors, wonderful support material and presentations. Great leink woth DataCamp, love it",5
5275,Now working on week 5 of this course. First four weeks were VERY well taught. Clear examples AND above all the datacamp R tutorials make it more than worth your while.This course rises FAR above the many Coursera MOOC's that i took. It is very complete and do-able.,5
5276,That is a great comprehensive course!,5
5277,Great explanations. Clear examples. I love the stories and the drawings. Good thought pedagogical concept.,5
5278,Great materials and teachers. This is one of the best courses I've found.,5
5279,nicely done guys!,5
5280,"Very good course, nice examples! Carry on with the good work!",5
5281,Very clear and awesome!,5
5282,Very well put together.,5
5283,Loved presentation style. Very simple way to teach complex concept.,5
5284,A difficult subject made easy and interesting.I wish there more exercise to practise home in order to master the concepts.,5
5285,Best course on statistics. Concepts explained in very simple language and through beautiful visualizations,5
5286,"Perfect material, Perfect instructors, and perfect course!",5
5287,Great class! Thank you for all clear explanation.,5
5288,"Great course, innovative design, great content and Organization. Great teachers and didactic..",5
5289,"Good lectures, but the R-lab is horrible. Do not take this class.",1
5290,"Only the firs week of this course, but I can already tell that it's going to be incredibly useful to me. I've learned a lot and especially love the introduction to R through datacamp!",5
5291,The best statistics course ever!,5
5292,"I think the notes given after the lectures should contain the formula the students need. Also the quizes should show the correct answers once you completed them, if not you cant figure out why the questions are wrong.",3
5293,---------- way too much time is devoted to introducing definitions and way too little time is given for student practicing and review . the presenter's accent is constantly impeding instant recognition of what he's saying. the subtitles sometimes don't ac,2
5294,Have recently passed the first week and I should say that was awesome!,5
5295,good course,5
5296,I found this course very helpful and understandable ...The slides are very beautiful designed ..I had never learnt Statistics in this way! The examples are related to our daily life! It makes everything easier to learn... Thank you very much all who works on this course from University of Amsterdam,5
5297,"Clear video's & examples, easy to follow",5
5298,Interesting subject and excellent presentation!,5
5299,"Very clear expectations, and the lectures were spaced out nicely to cover material while not being overwhelming. Additionally, the analogies used to convey the principles were clever and helpful!",5
5300,"It was uniquely designed, well written and extremely informative.",5
5301,"a good course, excellent professor, and content in acordance with my expectation....",5
5302,It helped me to open my eyes! Really great! Thank you all!,5
5303,This course was simply amazing!,5
5304,"Chris Impey eases into the subject of astronomy, with increasingly difficult subject matter as the course proceeds. However, he is very methodical and plain (in a good way) in his language, and his videos are a joy to watch. I started this course already interested in amateur astronomy and learned a lot of new things about the technology and methodology in astronomy. I'd recommend this to anyone who is really interested in astronomy. Be prepared to make a not insignificant commitment, because the course is nearly four months long! Time well spent in my opinion. Thank you to all who made this course possible.",5
5305,An excellent course full of fantastic information and videos. I would highly recommend this to anyone!,5
5306,5 star class. Period.,5
5307,Great course,5
5308,I enjoyed every minute of it because it satisfied my curiosity about learning more about what's out there!,5
5309,"Really enjoyed this course. Accessible, fun, and I've learned so much.",5
5310,Very easy to understand and the ideal course to open your accounts to astronomy.,5
5311,After acquiring 2 masters degree and beginning work on a doctorate I have found a course that has taught me more than many of the courses that I have taken in person. Astronomy: Exploring Space and Time has been very well designed and taught.,5
5312,The course is very well structured and touches a large range of topics. Professor Impey makes some of the lecture material very interesting and has simplified complex theories and concepts. However the Astropedia textbook needs to be updated with recent events.,5
5313,I Love Astrophysics And sir Please Add More Courses .,5
5314,excellent program for starting in the world of astronomy... It was a great pleasure to experience Chris' work... it a must do,5
5315,"Dr. Impey is skilled at covering a very broad range of topics and sciences that are all a part of ""astronomy"". The slides were clear. The transcripts helped to reinforce the information, although probably done with vocalization software as there are many sentence fragments, homonyms for the actual word, etc. I did not see a date done but I would guess this course was constructed in 2013-2014, so the information is certainly current.",5
5316,I most certainly loved it! The professor leads you through every step and aspect of the Astronomy with charisma and exactitude.,5
5317,"Excellent course and content. Learned a lot about a field which I way always curious about, but knew very little about. Highly recommended.",5
5318,"Very good course, loads of information brough on a way even I can understand",5
5319,Great class,5
5320,"One of the best courses around. It's not a graduate course, and it does not teach you the secret of physics, but the compact, vivid presentation gives you a great overview of the field and of the exciting things to come.",5
5321,Great course by a great professor!,5
5322,"Very interesting course. You can learn plenty of new things, more that you might imagine, with very funny videos from time to time. I recommend it to everybody.",5
5323,Enjoyed learning lots of astronomy stuff!,5
5324,"This has been a vastly enriching experience for me. Thanks to Prof. Impey, his team and Coursera for allowing knowledge and ideas to be expeirenced accross the world.",5
5325,Great course to know more about the universe.,5
5326,"An amazing course! Fascinating and engaging, well-documented and illustrated, with original activities, and a challenging subject matter. Don't hesitate to enroll!",5
5327,"You can grasp the beauty of life and the world around only by getting deep knowledge in Astronomy. The course is great. English pronunciation of the teacher is nice. Tests are good, looking for peer assessments in the future sessions.",5
5328,I enjoyed it a lot learning many subjects and topics about astronomy. It helps you get a wide view of astronomy science and learn the fundamentals.,5
5329,Well-balanced in terms of content and very informative course; did an excellent job in formulating complex concepts into digestible form. Thank you.,5
5330,Really interesting and exactly at the right level for me!!!Thanks to the teacher who is very clear and manages to communicate enthusiasm,5
5331,Clear explanations even for foreigners and lots of interesting interactive materials. The course will fit also for absolute beginners like I am. Very interesting lectures and I continue to watch online Q&A conferences with the Prof. with great pleasure! Thanks a lot! I had a lot of fun.,5
5332,"Course was excellent. Prof. was excellent. I am a retired nurse so I took the course because of my lifelong interest in astronomy, science and the unknown. My only complaint is that I could not complete the last quiz because I could not get the micro-observatory to work on my Mac OS. My husband is a computer engineer and he could not get it to work on his computer either. This was disappointing!",4
5333,Very nice. Something to improve: mix quizes with videos and not all videos first and then the quizes,4
5334,"I found this course to be very informative and enjoyable -- and demanding in terms of time. I am still catching-up on the text and am learning more and more even after completing the course. I recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about astronomy in the present. Chris is a very effective teacher, and his lectures/presentations are very interesting and informative.",5
5335,This is a really good course for learning all the amazing things in our universe. My favorite part is the opportunity to pose questions directly to Professor Impey on the YouTube Q&A sessions.,5
5336,"Well exceeded my expectations! Lots of science, yet never dry and boring.",5
5337,"I am very happy to have completed the course. I was able to learn a lot about various aspects of astronomy, especially galaxies and globular clusters that are objects that call my attention. I was able to read much of the material provided in teachastronomy, thank you for the kindness of making the material available. I watched all the videos of Professor Chris and I was able to follow well due to the availability of the subtitles in English, this was important. The interviews I could not follow completely by the lack of subtitles. This was a great opportunity for me that likes astronomy, but because of the distance that I live from the great centers of study, it is very difficult to access good and reliable information. I am very grateful and congratulate the institution for making this course available.",5
5338,"Excellent course for learning about the basics of astronomy. Amongst others it covers subjects as the history of astronomy, our sun and the solar system, comets, galaxies, quasars, pulsars and black holes. The course uses video's which clearly explain various topics with sheets and additional reading material provided.",5
5339,The BEST Astronomy course!,5
5340,fantastic.thanks,5
5341,Good and clear explanations. At the end it became more difficult since filosophie was involved which for me opened my ey. Some 'slides' are old fashioned.,4
5342,Very in-depth and interesting. Impey is a good lecturer and the videos provided are packed with information. I highly recommend this course.,5
5343,"In my opinion, This course is really useful for the people that have an extreme interest with astronomy and also the curious people want to exlore the masive universe. And i'm one of these people. In addition, I'm really happy when i found out this website while i was surfing my newfeed, Thank to this program, it's really lightful for a lot of questions always be held in my mind but know i have lighted up a lot.",5
5344,"Really good course, I would recommend it for all !!",5
5345,"I loved this course, and I will make it in the future again.Thanks Coursera, and University of Arizona, especially proffesor Chris Impey, you are awesome!!!",5
5346,Amazing course with top notch teaching!,5
5347,Brilliant course this was. Recommend to anyone who would like to know bit more about the Universe we live in.,5
5348,"Thank you very much! Excellent course, definitely one of the best astronomy courses I have done so far.",5
5349,"I am a First year master in software engineering, but also a really curious ""kid"". In my search for interesting course related to astronomy I found this one.Although I am only half way through the course I state that this is the most compelling course I have taken on Coursera. Since I have more then some knowledge of scientific method, physics and other topics talked about in the course, but not as much in astronomy I find the course tailored for me. Especially taking into account that this course is in the right spot between popular knowledge and a little bit of science and engineering.Prof. Impley is excellent in explaining, even amazing at some points :)",5
5350,Fantastic course for anyone interested in astronomy.,5
5351,Good one. Detailed.Too much of video clips from television etc. Can avoid those.,4
5352,"Great course, easy to follow and an excellent teacher...",5
5353,"Wonderful course, after some time I will repeat.Thank you very much Prof. Chris Impey, you have given me much insight.We keep in touch, best regards, Bob",5
5354,Professor Impey covers an extensive subject using a clear and instigating language. The assignments and tasks proposed helps a lot the comprehension and make you search for more information.One of the best online courses I have already had.Congratulations to Professor Impey and all team that produced the available material.,5
5355,A good introductory course in astronomy that extends even to intermediate astronomy. I highly recommend it!,5
5356,Most enjoyable and informative course. Thoroughly recommended.,5
5357,"The astronomy course exceeded my expectations. I learned a great deal from the video lectures and the astrpoedia textbook. I was surprised that preparing for the essay questions was also a good source for added knowledge in researching for the assignments. I am indebted to Chris Impey for the excellent lectures and course. Everything was well presented and explained well but I could not get up to understand much of the last lesson – Life in the Universe.In summary, great course and recommend it without reservations. Kudos and thanks to Chris Impey.",5
5358,I took the survey and hopefully I can continue with this course because I enjoy learning about Astronomy .I've taken other courses and hope that I can continue doing this . I have problems with my computer andtrying to understand the format but I will do my best because I do like to learn more about this subject.,4
5359,"Wonderful experience, most recommended",5
5360,Very Good Course I Love Astronomy Difficult butt Helpful course. I'm gain 89.8%. Good Percentage.,5
5361,This is a great course that covers a lot of fascinating topics. Professor Impey does a great job presenting the material. Thanks a lot for the interesting course.,5
5362,It is a very informative and systematically planned course.,4
5363,"Great beginners astronomy class, instructor is very detailed and have plenty of videos, charts, animations, ect for extra help.",5
5364,Great course! Presented in a way that is exciting and easy to follow. Perfect for those just begining in astronomy and a great refresher for those with more experience.,5
5365,The perfect course if you want a fresh start into the field of astronomy or need a thorough revision of the important basic concepts of the field. Definitely helped me with my revision.,5
5366,its really good,5
5367,Really Nice....,5
5368,Wonderful insight and delivery by instructor. Visual material very helpful for comprehension. Well Done!,5
5369,Simply fantastic course!,5
5370,"it's give the knowledge, make me better",4
5371,Great course. Really interesting. Live sessions. Excellent.,5
5372,"The teacher is one of the best i have ever seen, truly an expert in this field of science.",5
5373,"Very nice course, well planned out, with just a few mistakes. Overall, would recommend this course to anyone interested in astronomy.",5
5374,"This course is bad!I had come upto week 4. While Chris Impey is knowledgeable and good, the course structure is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired. I would venture to make some suggestions:a. Restrict each video to a max of 7 minutes. More than that makes one sleepy.b. Reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say 6.c. Instead of having Chris expound it like an audio reading, please include some slides, pictures,tables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and Chris doesn't have to speak so much. A good example is the Coursera ""The Global Financial Crisis"", which I am also doing currently.d. If you feel all the material in this course has to be studied, then to achieve the objectives in (a) and (b) above, divide this course into two parts, Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space - part I & II.e. The written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory. Can you make the questions more challenging? For example, in Telescopes (Assignment 2), can you not ask a question like ""In addition to Atacama, Chile, using Google earth, which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes?"" or ""To obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere, discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes?"" or ""What do you feel about the fact that since today's mobile phones have high computing ability, their components can be used to make a low-cost space based interferometric telescopes?""Kudos to Chris and his team! On the whole, knowledge wise, this is a good course.",1
5375,Thank you so much! I really enjoyed this course!,5
5376,"Many of the lectures were recorded years ago. But, the information is still great, and a little follow up research on the web will get you caught up.",5
5377,Excellent beyond words. I learned so much and became very motivated to continue further explorations on such a fascinating subject. We have the best tutor one can hope for: Pof. Chris Impey.,5
5378,"Well prepared, laid out and informative.",5
5379,Great conceptual level overview of many topics in and related to space and astronomy. Highly recommended.,5
5380,Very good and full of interesting information.,5
5381,"Great course, it opens your mind to broader perspective!",5
5382,I'm learning more about astronomy than ever before! This is truly fun!,5
5383,Great course.,5
5384,Looking forward to receive more information.,5
5385,"Excellent course, highly recommended",5
5386,"Very broad cover of the field, very well explained. I only wish there was more. Thank you.",5
5387,Excellent insight into the current state of astronomy.,5
5388,"it is an amazing subject, and it is well taught by professor Impey. It was so much fun the way he presented it, with a lot of nice multimedial material but also a lot of hard work to complete the course.",5
5389,"Great course, Professor Impey does a wonderful job of explaining this topic and keeping it interesting. Highly recommend his parallel book on the same topic, ""How It Began"".",5
5390,Brilliant Course. Excellent balance of hard and easier topics. Well delivered by the staff and very interesting. More courses like this please.,5
5391,This is an excellent course. I have learnt a great deal and found the course easy to follow when broken into bite size chunks. The quizzes and coursework have reinforced my learning. I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn about our universe.,5
5392,"Actually, i love astronomy more than anything, this course contains some of my favourite topics in astronomy and i love this course...",5
5393,I can't have my certirficate and already I pay for it!,1
5394,This course is the second couresera course which completed. It is always nice to learn from people who do frontier work in the field they teach. I thank coursera for giving me this wonderful opportunity. Sakthivel,4
5395,Wonderful!! I love it.,5
5396,Boring,1
5397,"exceptional course ¡For undergraduate students , teaches of sciences, and amateurs astronomers",5
5398,Fantastic course as well as the course materials.....thoroughly enjoyable,5
5399,"This course is a perfect course. Every title, video and exam is so great, in my opinion. I am learning many new things.",5
5400,"By far one of the best courses I have taken on Coursera. The amount of material is astounding and of great quality through and through. I highly recommend this course. Be prepared to work for your diploma, however.",5
5401,"I haven't quite finished the course yet, but so far it has been fascinating. Well done to the Coursera team and to Prof. Chris Impey, the course leader.",5
5402,"Although I was graduated from a faculty of science but the first lessons about evidence, uncertainty, imagination and hypothesis were COMPLETELY new for me,So thanks a lot for all of you especialy Dr.Chris Impey",5
5403,Great,5
5404,Liked it a lot.,5
5405,Good course inviting the scientific thought process to evolve instead of believing the old stories.,4
5406,A very interesting course about the basic concepts of astronomy with lots of additional funny videos and slides. Thanks a lot to professor Impey and everybody who created it!,5
5407,Perfect intro to astronomy and beyond!,5
5408,"The contents of the course are great and prof. Impey is a great communicator. The course is easy to follow, the final chapters on galaxies and cosmology are a bit more difficult but that is due to the nature of the subject and I applaud that the prof does not ""dumb it down"" or brushes over such difficult ans speculative subjects. I minor nuisance for me were the frequent songs and funny videos interspersed in the course content. It would have been better if they were separate from the main videos or otherwise could be easily skipped by people who don't have a lot of time. overall a great course!",4
5409,"Amazing course! Chris Impey is a wonderful teacher. The lectures are captivating, but at a level that is appropriate for astronomy beginners. The quizzes are only easy if you were paying attention, and the writing assignments consolidate the material. This course has made me even more interested in the subject and since starting it I have even gone beyond the scope of this course and done my own investigations. Definitely recommended.",5
5410,"Learned loads and still learning, and Prof. Chris Impey is awesome and a great teacher.",5
5411,"Awesome course! Thank you, Dr. Impey!",5
5412,"I am i week 5, for now I found this course very attractive",5
5413,"I really like the way the videos were made, it's literally like a 1-1 session wiv the professor himself. I have learnt a lot in the process of completing each assignment, also it has done nothing but build my love for astronomy and space itself even further than it was.",5
5414,"I love the well-prepared, accessible style of the course. I also enjoyed how it progressed in building block style. I will be downloading and rewatching many episodes trying to absorb more information. I will definitely take it again next time it's around!Thanks for all your hard work!",5
5415,"This is a very thorough and informative introduction to the field of astronomy, and contains a lot of practical information that everyone interested in the night sky can use.",5
5416,"I am in LOVE with this course. No, seriously. I can't stop talking about it. With EVERYONE I MEET. I have a degree in Chemistry, and teach Earth Science and Chemistry to high school students, so my knowledge about science for this course is up to par, but I like that it adds a LITTLE more info, and it's going to give me a chance to bring stuff back to my students. The text book is amazing, and the videos are on point. Thanks for a great class!",5
5417,Very informative.,5
5418,"Though I dont have the resources for the certficate, this is a great course to continue or start your interest in astronomy.",5
5419,"This is the best course I have done in Coursera. The use of animations, videos, resources, The occasional humor and the way the lecturer addressed each topic. Simply amazing!!",5
5420,A really overwhelming quantity of information and an amazing presentation covering a wide spectrum of Astronomy,5
5421,The delivery of the material was excellent. Very informative and interlaced with,5
5422,"I get here a lot of useful and interesting knowledge, and the professor explains everything very well, so that everybody can understand it.",5
5423,Bravo! Enjoying these lectures immensely!,5
5424,"This course covers a lot of interesting materials of astronomy, ranging from planets to galaxies, very suitable for beginners. Those who have trouble with maths don't have to worry, it's not part of this course. The length of video lectures are short, thus getting distracted during the lecture will not be easy.",5
5425,"it provides me a lot new point of view knowledge , and it broads my eyes of view, and i appreciate the astonishing new ideas and concepts.",5
5426,"An excellent presentation by Chris Impey with didactical explanations, among the best if not the best course in astronomy for amateurs.",5
5427,An excellent course with a broad coverage of topics presented at a relatively sophisticated conceptual level but still easy to understand and requiring little math. A great starting point for getting a comprehensive overview of astronomy at its current stage of development with insights into future directions.,5
5428,This is awesome,5
5429,"I am only a few weeks into it, but those first few weeks have been absolutely fascinating. I'll come bac at the end with a final score.",5
5430,Good explanations about the topics.,4
5431,an excellent course in order to start a career as a professional Journalist. Thank you all,5
5432,"Excellent opportunity to show off the skill sets learned . As a returning journalist, I knocked off the rust and picked up a few new skills. Deadlines, which you live on in the industry help you get acquainted with performing work on a tight schedule. This class along with the other offered MSU Journalism Specialization courses will give you what you'll need to get a foot in the door.",5
5433,"Overall this course was great but I wish that the timeline was a little clearer from the get-go. I had to rush at the end because I didn't realize week 2 was for finding sources, week 3 was for contacting them, week 4 was for interviews, etc...If the MSU staff could have given their feedback on our final projects, that would have been another plus, but I know it's difficult with so many students.",4
5434,A great course to learn Journalism,5
5435,"Thank you for sharing us the guidance for creating the Capstone Project, the final Course under Specialization - Journalism, Report the News!Enjoyed it very much, also the time spent to review my peers objectively as much as I enjoyed reading their reviews.Is there going to be other related writing studies from MSU through Coursera?Best Regards,Monika Pandiangan (Monik)",4
5436,"Excellent course, excellent teacher. All key concepts are covered well.",5
5437,"I learned a lot but I felt that the final project was significantly more difficult than the work leading up to it, and there was no support I could find or access via the class itself.",4
5438,That´s great!,5
5439,Great course with deeper dive into the mobile developement. You need to know that much unaided work is considered.,5
5440,"Good Course, but it needs more focus on ContentProviders and Services.",4
5441,Moves too fast,4
5442,"Overall this course has some valuable information. Although, I found the pace was a bit fast, only covered enough to get by, not gradually building up to a point. Each assignment or lab you first have to struggle figuring out the skeleton code where they could have provided a bit more comments, tips and guidance. I would recommend this course for someone that at least have a basic Java or programming background. Not for complete new developers.",3
5443,"Like part 1 this course is very informative for anyone new to android development. Pacing is good. The assignments are well developed and clear, although I found one to be on the really tricky side. Good course.",4
5444,"There are no lectures on Services, and Content Providers which are two key components of the Android system. It really disappointed me.",3
5445,I think the exercises could be more deep.,4
5446,"Honestly, I find it very hard to recommend this course to anyone. First of all, let's note that the course covers quite more advanced topics than the previous 3 courses in the specialization, so some extra difficulty is to be expected. However, the main problem I encountered was with the video lectures themselves, particularly during the 3rd and 4th week of the course. The instructor does a very rushed job at explaining everything, constantly giving us tons of information and jargon that is not previously mentioned, and even the examples fail to give us insight at what we need to do and why.Other than the lectures, no external material is given to help us decipher what the professors are saying, other than a few Wikipedia links. I'm not saying that each course should be accompanied by an e-book, but honestly, if I wanted to learn about Bayesian Statistics from Wikipedia I could have well skipped this class.The main reason I'm giving 2 stars to the course instead of 1 is the Labs and the Quizzes. Even though they could use some polishing too, especially the final Lab, they are indeed very helpful and do a much better job at clarifying the concepts presented.All in all, I feel that if you want to learn about Bayesian Statistics you should look for another course, and/or save your money and get yourselves a good textbook.",2
5447,very difficult but it is interesting,5
5448,"This course makes a valiant effort to provide as much coverage of Bayesian statistical methods as the prior three courses in the ""Statistics in R"" specialization do for Frequentist statistical methods, but the lack of supporting material (e.g. reading/text exercises directly paired with each lesson) really hampers this. The videos are quite informative, but if you don't catch on to the material based strictly on the videos, the weekly quizzes can be a bit frustrating.",2
5449,"The first three courses in this Duke series were superbly well done. I have taken numerous courses from Harvard and Johns Hopkins, and none of them compare in quality of execution of the first three Duke courses in this series.And then there was Bayesian Statistics: much of the ""instruction"" in this course was truly awful. The quality of the slides and video and so on was still excellent, but the ""teaching"" was horrible. Vast amounts of totally unexplained jargon and very extensive equations were thrown at the students with the apparent assumption that the course was a review for postdoctoral statistics students. When material is beyond the scope of what perspective students can reasonably be expected to understand, faculty members should be honest enough to just say so rather than pretending to teach the subject matter.I appreciate very much what the Duke faculty achieved in the first three courses, but the treatment of Bayesian statistics that I have just suffered through was shameful.",1
5450,Good content but sometimes it gets confusing.,4
5451,"This is easily the worst course in the Statistics with R specialization. Contrary to the earlier courses, which were very competently taught by Dr Cetinkaya-Rundel, teaching quality is very poor in this course. Both of the main instructors are unable to explain what's going on. There is vagueness and ambiguity, which is almost impossible for the uninitiated to resolve. All in all, a very frustrating experience. The course would urgently need re-recording. As it stands, it shows a huge disrespect for the student's time and effort.",1
5452,"After 3 great courses in this specialization, this one was disappointing. The content just isn't explained well in the videos. The Labs were fine. I'm sorry but the course seemed rushed, and it isn't great marketing for the Bayesian approach. As a consequence, I am now not sure if I want to do the capstone......",3
5453,Excellent content. Gives a very different outlook of Bayesian Stats.,5
5454,For sure the most challenging course so far.I'm amazed by how our statistical intuition fits with Bayesian approach and how we can get better results.I'm eager to use this concepts in new models at my job!,5
5455,"This class assumes a lot of statistical knowledge and background that is not covered in the first three classes of the series. So much statistical terminology and jargon was used by the instructor, it felt like taking a class in another language where I had to constantly stop the video and google for the terminology she used. It took a lot of grit to finish the class, which was overall a very demoralizing and negative experience.",1
5456,I would've saved a lot of time by knowing the R commands used in this course. It took so long to figure out things and I I didn't like the course because of that.,2
5457,"Good introduction to Bayesian concepts, but the course would benefit of some rethought of design of exercises.",2
5458,Very good course.,5
5459,"This course is very good for bayesian statistic theory. What is more, it also teaches a lot of coding skills with R which is really useful.",5
5460,"Theis course is substantially more difficult than the three first ones, and the material is scarce. However, I must admit that this is one of the courses I have ever learnt the most",4
5461,Bayesian stats is a broad topic. Learners would benefit from more material.,4
5462,"very helpful, however there is no recourse or recommend information for reference textbook.",5
5463,"This is my first course on bayesian statistics, I really like it, it was step by step, and helps to clarify lots of concepts of frequentist statistic.",5
5464,"The material is good. However, there is no support from the instructors to answer our questions in the discussion forum.",4
5465,"Good course, but need more details.",3
5466,Too Fast. Video is too short and spend a lot of time in the summary.,2
5467,Very theoretical and unstructured,2
5468,"The first three classes in this certification were excellent; this course was anything but that. There seems to be a significant disconnect between the first three courses (probability, inference, linear regression) and the fourth course (bayesian). I do not have a strong statistics background but I felt the first three classes in the certification challenged me, while providing an adequate level of support and thorough / articulate examples; the pace was perfect. Yet, with the fourth course I believe that either: 1) there needs to be a bridge course that prepares you for the bayesian course, or 2) the material needs to be taught at a slower pace with more specific and well presented examples / frameworks to work from. Although I was able to complete the course, I will now have to find an alternative source to learn from in order to really understand bayesian stats.",1
5469,"Very nice introduction to bayesian statistics, the materials have some level of depth, and the tests and assignments are highly available for beginners.",5
5470,"Very interesting and formative. It starts from the basics (Bayes' theorem) but then it goes beyond the usual conjugate models such as Beta-binomial and Gamma-Poisson. Bayesian Linear Regression, Bayes Factors, Bayesian Model Averaging and a brief introduction to MCMC are provided. This really put me in the position of applying Bayesian Statistics to some real world application: the final test case is a good illustration. The only minus is that the part on Bayesian Hypothesis Testing (in particular Bartlett's and Lindley's paradoxes) is a bit rushed up, and not as clear as the rest of the course. All in all, a really good course, I'm glad I followed it.",5
5471,The professors know what they are doing but not good at making the concepts plain to the students who don't have the strong background. Most of the times I would just ask myself why they did this and that but later they don't provide enough explanations.,2
5472,Very good introduction to Bayesian Statistics. Very interactive with Labs in Rmarkdown. Definitely requires thinking and a good math/analytic background is helpful.,5
5473,Great course with clear instruction and a final peer-review project with clear expectations and explanations.,5
5474,I get really frustrated when the tutor doesn't explain lots of concept/symbols in the materials.....,1
5475,I found some of the instructional videos a bit confusing. It was difficult to understand the underlying methodology of some of the concepts explained. I believe the instructors assumed the students had a more rigorous understanding of the underlying calculus than was suggested for this course.,3
5476,"Outstanding material. It may be the hardest level compared to the rest specialization course, since Bayes indeed have high technical level detail. But it was worth it. Great course and detailed from the instructors.",5
5477,"This course needs much more work from instructors before it gets offered to the public. It is poorly assembled, offers hardly comprehensible material with no or very few resources to turn to. Reading material is listed, but they are useful for people already skilled in Bayesian Statistics. Exercises are worded such, that even the questions are a challenge to understand. Quizzes contain material never mentioned during lessons. Discussion forums are left unanswered by the teaching staff - or if they reply, they do it in a very negligent manner. No support on the merits. A major disappointment.",1
5478,Excellent introductory course!,5
5479,"About two years ago I completed Dr. Mine's course ""Data Analysis and Statistical Inference"" and was quite impressed by it. I always hoped that there'd be a follow up on bayesian statistics, so I was really excited when I heard that a course on this topic had finally been created. However while attending the course I became more and more disappointed. Dr. Mine does a nice job explaining things, other teachers in this course aren't as talented. Most slides / videos are quite useless for teaching because they skip over important steps without giving appropriate explanations. Also I was quite disappointed that this course pretty much only focuses on conjugate priors. MCMC is only skimmed over and the introduction to MCMC is more than questionable - instead of showing a simple example, MCMC is squeezed into the topic of bayesian model selection. Another point is R - this course doesn't really teach bayesian stats with R. It teaches how to call one-liners like bayes_inference (from package statsr) or bas.lm (from package BAS) instead of lm. This is totally disappointing. I wish this course would skim over conjugate prior methods and then focus on MCMC sampling methods by teaching how to build interesting and practically useful models using JAGS/STAN/PyMC/whatever. For anyone interested in bayesian stats I'd recommend reading ""Doing Bayesian Data Analysis - Using R, JAGS, and STAN"" and ""Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers"". These books are actually cheaper than this course.",1
5480,"I had a lot of fun during this course, but I think it is simply too short to present all the topics in sufficient detail. Furthermore, I took this course without doing the prior courses in the specialization, and there were a couple of moments when I really thought previous knowledge from a different course was required.I think for the most part the lecturers did a great job in explaining the materials in the course. The lectures themselves were also well structured, and the topics followed each other in a logical order. I would have loved to spend more time on modeling techniques and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.",4
5481,"Mismatch between assessment and course content. After not being able to pass the assessment, I've fallen behind on the course and I'm too busy to catch up.",2
5482,"This course was the most challenging one among all courses in specialization. I wish there were more explonation of how we get smth from smth and not like "" and it appears to be equal .."" and so on.I also had to watch Ben Lambert's bayesian course on YouTube to understand the material of the second week,because Prof. David Banks was not good enough in explanation.Assistant Prof. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel has an amazing teaching skills.Prof. Merise Clyde is good in explonations and I understand that she tried to present a very complicated material in a simple way, but as I have already mentioned above, I wish there were more explonations of casuality of the formulas with examples and Intuition that stands behind these formulas like in Ben Lambert's videos.Many thanks for such an amazing experience.",5
5483,"I hope we can have access to the slides, and this can save attendees a lot of time, because I think after we finished watching the video we can skip relevant slides when we come across problems in doing exercise.",4
5484,"This course clearly has come ambition to cover important topics on bayesian statistics, however, probably due to time limit, the lecturers have to skim through the contents without further, sometimes necessary explanations. As a result, the lectures are difficult to follow.",2
5485,"This course is not well-presented. Lectures are unimaginative, and there isn't enough supporting material or readings.",1
5486,"This course covers a good amount of bayesian statistics. However, the presentation/videos starting from week 2 really sucks. They change instructors for difference topics and obviously some instructors are not very good at explaining other than reading the material.The videos skipped many medium steps that are actually very crucial for understanding the concepts. And no suggested reading materials at all either. Also the quiz are not very well designed either. For example, some quiz are much more simpler than the course material, which makes it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself. While some times it is the opposite.The first three courses in this specialization are very good, but somehow this course are way below the quality of the previous ones.",2
5487,The course lacks of explanation and it's very difficult to follow. It seems that the instructor just reads the slides without reasoning and explanation. Suggested reading materials are needed.,1
5488,"The section about Beta-Binomial Conjugate is taught very fast and unless the student is quite familiar with Beta and Gamma distributions, it makes it very difficult to follow the course.",4
5489,"I don't understand how come this course can get such high reviews. My experience with this course is horrible. First of all, most quiz are poorly designed, lots of mistakes. For instance, there are 10 Qs in week 1, 3 of them have mistakes. Wasted me tons of times.Lectures are also difficult to follow. Instructors usually just give formulas without further explanation. I forced myself to go through them until week 4, I finally give it up. I feel like it is a waste of my time. I need to find a better course on this topic.Most coursera courses are very well designed. This one is the worst I have ever experienced.",1
5490,very useful,5
5491,"I beta-tested this course and it was an amazing experience. The instructors are super engaging and upbeat, despite having to delivery a very complex subject like Bayesian statistics. The quizzes are very rich, with a nice balance of practice quizzes and graded quizzes. The practice quizzes offer very helpful explanations that can help to reinforce understanding before doing the graded quiz. Last but not least, the final project description is super exciting and thorough. I highly look forward to completing this course and get a deep introduction to Bayesian statistics.",5
5492,Pl send me the Certificate. Its overdueSanjay Banka,5
5493,"Very powerfull, thanks a lot!",5

5509,Very informative for expanding my skills and terminology.,4
5510,Very clear c,4
5511,Way too general..,2
5512,too many theory and too boring,1
5513,"The instructor kept referring to different authors and books as if she wasn't sure what she was saying was true. She was just reading off a screen and not actually teaching. Might have been easier, and a bit more beneficial, to just read a well prepared set of slides on my own. The first set of quiz questions also weren't really relevant to what was in the actual lesson. Quite disappointed in this part of the specialization as the other sections had in depth presentations, clear information, lots of examples and great slides.",2
5514,"Very interesting and inspiring course. The material is of very good quality and the teacher is, to my mind, excellent.",5
5515,I couldn'tfinish this course because it was too much the. I wish it had a more practical aspect.,2
5516,Great course. It has some important points to consider in a negotiation.,5
5517,"Great, great teacher! I am so inspired by her.",5
5518,Great short course. Like the main points brought up. Would have been great to have some real case studies of negotiations that went well and badly to learn from. Even a reading of cases hre would have set the whole thing in context.,5
5519,The course is mostly theoretical,4
5520,Good resources and material for self study. The Guest separe was very interesting.,4
5521,thanks,5
5522,Nice explanation about negotiation.,5

5527,"great tips , new world has opened for me.",5
5528,Very good. Could use more on soft skills.,4
5529,"Very good course, I recommend!",5
5530,I think this is a great course. It gives me more fundamental knowledge in negotiation. Although it provides details all information but give us a overview when start a negotiation with everyone or any organization.,5
5531,It was a very helpful class to learn strategies to improve performance in a negotiation table.,5
5532,I like that the course covered negotiation in general in relatively short time. However I found the lectures were too dry and theoretical as they lacked real life examples.,2
5533,She is fluent just like reading the scripts.,1
5534,Good Course. Topics are well explained.,4
5535,Excellent!!! This course provides right framework to handle any negotiation...,5
5536,Succinct and to the point;Great content;The professor is clear and confident.,5

5541,Good course!!!,5
5542,I had a hard time paying attention to the woman speaking and dropped the course after completing week one.,2
5543,Great course!,5
5544,"There is no discussion forum. There are some concepts made me confused and I want to discuss with some other classmates. Another thing is there almost has no example, teacher just say the principles. I think one or two example for a principle may make some concepts more clear and can be understood easier.",3
5545,Very good points. Logical and concisely presented. Will definitely influence the way that I approach a negotiation. Particularly like the idea that both parties need to come away satisfied with the outcome.,4
5546,"Very insightfull course thank you very much i,m very appriecieted",5
5547,the course structure and content are very good and interesting!,5
5548,"Useful Course, very informative.",4
5549,This is the best Negotiation course I have attended. It is focused on principles negotiation and takes us through the steps needed to become a successful and honest negotiator. Great delivery. Thank you.,5
5550,Totally worth taking this course if you intend to improve your negotiation skills from simply haggling and bargaining to true win-win agreements.,4
5551,"Very bad course. The content can barely be applied outside US, you don't know from which perspective it's explained (for sales or purchasing people), the videos are bad quality, the teacher is babbling, no extra resources, no interaction with the audience outside the assessments.",1
5552,This course offered nothing significant or new to anyone who has spent any time around business or government negotiations. It really seems as though the instructor either assumes all of her students are completely inept or that because it is a free course that producing a reasonably viable product is not necessary.,1
5553,Thank you. At least I know something about negotiations that I can use in everyday transactions.,5
5554,"Great course! Summarized the experiences I had on actual negotiation. Also provided good tips, hint and resources for further study to improve my negotiation skills.",4
5555,"Very Good,",5

5560,The answers to the test questions can be improved significantly. Most of them can be both justified or refuted.,2
5561,"The Instructor doesn't give enough info about principles and her presentation skills are very week,the studying material also are very poor",1
5562,"succinct, down-to-earth and focused on the essentials - just what I wanted and got! However, certainly no substitute for a negotiation course e.g. as part of an MBA. Overall a bit colourless.",4

5575,Excelent teacher and course!,5
5576,Excellent course and excellent teachers! Highly recomended.,5
5577,Great course. All lectures provide a biological context for the tools you learn in the labs. The labs themselves provide a great introduction to the many tools available for bioinformatic analysis.,5
5578,I learned many concepts in molecular biology and also how to use some tools to run genetic data. I'm so thankful for the opportunity to have been engaged in this amazing course.,5
5579,The teacher is boring but he conveys all information clearly.,4
5580,"Very nice, I would have liked to go deeper in NGS and RNA seq but is good as starter, I recommend it!",4
5581,"Course depends too much on multiple third-party sites to be as enlightening as I had hoped. I learned about some great resources, but that's about it.",1
5582,Simplified and very useful course,5
5583,It is a very nice course for beginners. I learnt a lot from it. Thank you!,4
5584,Great course easy to follow highly recommend it. Thank you.,5
5585,"Nice course, useful to know the most common tools used to do Bioinformatics",4
5586,The videos were very clear on how to use various bioinformatic tools. I found no difficulty in understanding them. Really enjoyed the course. Looking forward to the next part of this course!,5
5587,"The course is excellent, the lecturer is brilliant. Maybe it is a bit tough for students, also background in biology, chemistry and biochemistry is very helpful. Nevertheless I will recomend it to my advanced students because it absorbs and makes significant progress in understanding or the modern tools and techniques in bioinformatics. And the second part of the course is promised to be even more interesting.",5
5588,very useful,5
5589,It was a relevant course teaching basic bioinformatics. the course was well-structured and not hard-to follow,5
5590,An excellent course that expands on previously known topics in life sciences.,5
5591,Excellent and informative course!,5
5592,A very well structured course with graded difficulty and accurate instructions. Throughly enjoyed being a part of it.,5
5593,"A short and sweet, to-the-point course. This course helped me in getting a hang of some of the most widely used softwares and techniques required for bioinformatics. Only issue-some of the questions in certain quizzes have been assigned wrong choices as the answer, which led to a lot of confusion. They just wouldnt accept the right answer, so you are forced to mark the wrong ones and proceed.",4
5594,One of the basic and efficient enough to get familiar with the world of bioinformatics. Must for the ones who wants to excel deeper in the field of bioinformatics.,5
5595,Very good starting point or restarting point for working with sequence data as a compuational biologist. Very clear course with good lab sessions.,4
5596,Awesome course. The lectures are good and the lab portion is great. The lab really helps understanding how to use online tools and resources.,5

5599,repeat the class,5
5600,"This course is great! The materials provided are topnotch. In addition, the instructor was very active in the discussion forums during the period i enrolled; He was very helpful. As well as students who had enrolled at that period of time. (July to September 2016)I think anyone with some background in molecular biology can handle this course. Plus, do most of the labs in Firefox or any other browser namely Opera, Safari as an example. Google chrome doesn't support the Java apps you'll use in this course.",5
5601,A very interesting course and a great starting point towards bioinformatics,4
5602,Very usefull!! Who want to learn the basic methods of bioinfo i recomend this course!,5

5605,Very organized. The labs are extremely helpful!,5
5606,"Great Introduction to the topics and broad concepts of bioinformatics. If you are looking for a course that goes gives you a sense of the breadth of the field, this is the place to start. The learn-at-your-own-pace was also great for me, since time commitments and travel schedules make it difficult for me to block out a set time each week to complete each lesson-- so the flexibility was great!",5
5607,Very useful for a wide variety of biologist profiles,5
5608,quiz questions are well explained so much that I could follow easily! Good examples for learning!,5
5609,good but lengthy videos..,5
5610,Great and indepth introduction for those interested in learning bioinformatics. Next stop: Bioinformatic Methods II,5
5611,"I personally found the course very useful. It provides a good overview of some of the most widely used bioinformatic tools nowadays, without being too demanding. That labs are particularly good, and you are able to explore at your own pace but with the necessary guidance. I have a background in molecular and cell biology, so I found it very easy to follow.",5
5612,"Excellent course, I've learnt a lot. Maybe the labs are a little ""do what I'm saying"", but that is only if you are looking for the Certificate. If you dedicate enough time to read and ""play"" a little bit, it's a very complete course.",5
5613,"It's a very useful course, very well explained",5
5614,Very good course for beginners!,5
5615,"It was very well taught, I very much enjoyed taking this course and I appreciate producers efforts.",5
5616,Good campaign for abolishing illiteracy.It would be good to update answers for the final quiz (BLAST search and phylogenetic assay).,5
5617,"It was an excellent course! Very well explained and paced. Thank you, very much, Dr. Provart.",5
5618,it is a very good courses. I learnt a lot about how to build a phylogenetic tree here.,5
5619,"The best course ever ! Easy, well teached and breathtaking.This course helped me a lot in my university in my undergraduation. You can get a good knowledge about bioinformatics enough to work with it, and these teachings is necessary to improve skills to get better in this area.",5
5620,"It's great that the course is self-paced, I could start the course immediately to learn things that I immediately need in my work and classes. The bioinformatics tools discussed in this course are very helpful and explained in a clear manner. The instructor provides a lot of useful tips. In all, this course touches upon each of the major fields of bioinformatics that any student entering the field should know. It is suitable for those who are knew to this field, and also fascinating for those who have some prior knowledge.",5
5621,Really great course.,5
5622,"On the theoretical side, this is a very good introduction, and clearly a lot of effort has been poured into the practical part - only for that, the Toronto team deserves a lot of credit. Sadly, it suffers from the same problem as nearly every intro course in bioinformatics: the labs are merely a set of instructions to follow... even the very last. Still, if you never heard of BLAST or how to draw a phylogenetic tree, this is the course to do.",4
5623,"Very good and complete course. Even having some basic background with bioinformatics, this course was still valuable in order to further cement previously learned concepts, as well as learn some new concepts and tools.",5
5624,This is an absolutely fantastic course!,5

5633,There was a lot of stuff I could immediately use for my work. some of the other stuff was good to know to better understand what can be done behind the scene.,4
5634,Set such a solid foundation for beginners to start their research career using bioinformatic tools!,5
5635,A thorough course for beginners with very interesting labs! I was pleasantly surprised with how much and how easily I learned bioinformatics skills with this course. Well done!,4
5636,"One of the better courses I've taken, the combination of the hands-on labs and the review videos helps to understand some of the more complicated concepts.",5
5637,"Excellent course! The course is enjoyable and thorough, and at the same time, it does not require any deeper molecular biology knowledge or extra computational skills.",5
5638,It is very useful and helpful. Thank you very much Coursera and special thanks to dear Dr. Nicholas Provart.,5
5639,"A good, interesting and attractive introduction to Bioinformatic methods. Professor Provart is able to make thing easy, whilst showing you how to exploit data and tools freely - well ... usually, they are for free - available on the Internet.I suggest this course to everyone approaching the topic. Personally, I will also take Bioinformatic Method II to be initiated to elements of structural Bioinformatic methods.The 5th star is missing because I would like to have some more insights about some underlying ""reasons why"". But, I reckon this as my own peculiarity.Good job, Professor Provart! And thank you very much for this!",4

5641,"As a biochemist, it is a nice refresher for me !",4
5642,"Great course. The lectures were very clear and informative. The labs were a very nice, easy way to get a hands on understanding of the tools being learned. Thank you!",5
5643,"Very practical introduction to bioinformatics tools from a biological perspective. Labs were excellent, and the quizzes were mostly well-designed. Only downside is that some required software/web tools are difficult to run on Linux, but that's unavoidable given the field.",5
5644,"The step where traditional biology end, bioinformatics starts...There is no doubt in that.",5
5645,The submission system for submitting assignments in most of the cases does not work.,3
5646,I learned a lot and had fun at the same time,5
5647,good course . If there will any Speech recognition course it will useful > Hope Coursera will start speech recognition course in future .,5
5648,"Very well presented and thorough investigation into spectrogram, STFT and reconstruction techniques. Enjoying thanks.",5
5649,"I learned a lot during this course. It took quite a lot of time and energy to complete it, but I'm glad I did. It is now much easier to follow the text of Richard Lyons' book. Highly recommended.",5
5650,"this course is really great. lectures, code samples and references are clear and completeabsolutely recommended",5
5651,This is a really good course if you wish to start learning about Audio signal processing concepts.,5
5652,A real gem of a course in Coursera. It covers all the aspects of the topics discussed on Audio Signal Processing ranging from In-depth Theory to excellent examples & demonstration to programming aspects.,5
5653,This course gives quite some fundumental concepts about the audio signal processing. I like it!!,5
5654,"Brilliant course! Good balance between theory and implementations with Python. Also, very good additional materials - video lectures from Julius Smith, if you want to go even deeper into math theory.",5
5655,"The course is very well explained, the assignment are really interesting and the topic is very interesting as well.If you never worked with coding, the beginning may be a bit tricky, but everything is well explained. Take your time to view the videos, they always help if you have some problems.",5
5656,Thank you!,5
5657,"exceptional course -- expect good amount of work, but then you get lots out of it (as with any good course)",5
5658,Very good course. You learn basics of Audio digital Processing while you learn how to use software that is open source. I really enjoy programing and learning Python and more because it was totally applied.,5
5659,Excellent course with engaging activities. Highly recommended.,5
5660,Very well explained and organized course material. The classes are also very detailed and special emphasis is put on illustrating every concept with example plots.,5
5661,"Top class! Very well explained, good examples, excellent learning material, practical exercises, and lots and lots of room for further personal study! Well done guys, and especially Xavier! Cheers!",5
5662,"Great support from teacher, super clear explanation and excelent level of information!",5
5663,nice class!,5
5664,"i will thanks to management, i really need to learn this course because my FYP is based on this course",4
5665,This course is what i have been longing for :))),5
5666,Awesome! Just the preview of the course already made me excited! :D :D :D,5
5667,Too many errors in the graded assignments.,2
5668,Great course!,5
5669,Extremely interesting but could be more detailed showing more specific data and examples with downloadable spreadsheets.,4
5670,I've learnt a lot with this course. Sometimes we don't stop to think about how to think on making decision.,5
5671,"Quite disappointing. Lecturers / tutors no responding in time, and the solution provided are questionable, which already happened in earlier courses of this specialisation.",2
5672,Great course on application of behavioural finance in business decision making,5
5673,"I didn't learn anything more than what I already knew- which was basic concepts- and was able to pass anyway. I'm very disappointed. I want to be a good programmer, and this did not teach me any programming.The videos are not conducive to learning. You need a more engaging teaching plan. Don't just read slides to me, I can do that myself. Use videos to explain concepts, but stuff your videos with practice problems. Put more code in the videos and walk me through it. Put in mini-quizzes in the middle of videos, to keep the student aware of how they are doing in short increments. Don't move on to the next thing unless they have learned the first thing.I was unable to complete the projects because the practical coding was not taught - don't throw a third of the course into the first practice I get to without first walking me through short, contained examples of how to actually use the code, and testing me on each piece before putting it all together.",1
5674,Gives an in-depth explanation about how intents and broadcast receivers work in android.,4
5675,"The entirety of this course is ""watch and listen"". There are no hands-on activities/assignments that get you implementing what you are (supposedly) learning. The assignments that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picture.For example - they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky, but they don't actually give you a required assignment. It's optional. Then the actual assignment is ""Do this here, and this here, and then this here"" and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code. But this doesn't actually show you how to build the intent. All you did was write down what they told you to and where. You never actually build anything yourself. You don't actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratch.The quizzes are also pointless. Every quiz is multiple choice, select all that apply. There's no thought required, just regurgitation of info from the lectures.Also, the entire week 1 lectures are HORRIBLE. The lectures on git are sssoooo dull that I could not stay awake no matter how much I wanted to. They are given in a monotone, bored tone that will drive you insane.Overall, this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together, without much thought, and then never looked at again. I would not recommend anyone take this course, let alone pay for it.",1
5676,"A lot of information to be absorbed.I like how up-to-date the material is, though in some cases a a little too 'fresh'---assignments need some clean-up.For the app case studies and assignments, should add simple UML sequence and/or collaboration diagrams to the existing class diagrams.This would help to better illustrate the interactions of the various Android classes---especially if it could be animated.",4
5677,"The programming exercises should not be optional. I still intend to do them, but now I passed the course with a 100% mark but only 10% of knowledge.",2
5678,Very nice course..,5
5679,"More practical application would be helpful in solidifying knowledge. Concepts seem abstract outside of any programming practice. Additionally, flow of lectures seems scattered at times: concepts are introduced then not expounded upon. This creates a distracted learning path that makes it difficult to follow the lessons. (From a beginner programmer's view).",1
5680,"It was a good Mooc, but I think it should imply many more examples to be made by the own students along the course. I really liked the previous one (Java for Android) and of course I´m going to finish the rest of courses. It´s worth it. On the other hand, examples are good and explanations properly presented. Good... but not as good as the previous.",3
5681,Not enough coding opportunities.,3
5682,I really liked the course. I would have preferred to have been forced to do the optional assignment as it takes that little bit of extra motivation coming up to Christmas to do these optional assignments. I still plan to do them but being forced to do them to get a pass would help.Otherwise I really like what I learning and how its presented. Just need to use it somehow to get a job!,4
5683,"There is a lot of good information in the course about how different components communicate with each other in android; however, there is way too much information way too fast. I really enjoyed the rhythm in the first course but, this course left me lost more times than not. Its a great course if you plan on spending large amounts of time searching the web for other resources to complete the optional assignments",3
5684,Very helpful! requires strong coding skills.,4
5685,"This course was fantastic. I feel bad for complaining about the delay it had before launching because now I can see it was worth it. The material is up to date and the code adheres to the recommended Android code style from Google's documentation. The material is so much more thorough than other Android learning resources I've tried. Not only do you get good explanations of the example apps, but the lecture videos themselves do a good job of explaining the concepts at a high level before you get into the code. I found that the lecture videos gave me so many ""eureka"" moments where the whole picture was easier to understand.My only complaint is that the grading is 100% quizzes. I don't find these particularly engaging, and I prefer completing assignments that must pass unit testing/an autograder etc. I'm still giving 5 stars because this didn't detract from my experience. I'm pretty self-motivated so I just made my own challenges and didn't move on until I was able to code examples of what we learned each week.This specialization is without a doubt the first thing I'd point someone who expressed interest in learning Android to.",5
5686,"Very good and high level course. The reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is coz this course uses two topics both of which were not covered in Java for Android Course : Java Concurrency/Threads and Java 8 lambda expressions. So I had to take a side route to learn these topics. Also if the programming assignments could be made non-optional and auto graded, that would be great.",4
5687,This Course has been GREAT,5
5688,"This course will give you an understanding of how different Android App components interact. You will learn how and when to use the HaMeR and Asynctask frameworks, also, you'll see which patterns they implement. The Official Android Development Guide is a perfect complement for this course if you want to understand some programming details and get in deep.",5
5689,"Course work was entirely optional and only started at the end of week 2. The required level of involvement was too low to be helpful. I don't learn well just watching lectures - I can get that much from YouTube!!! However, I expect a bit more when paying $500 for a specialisation.The first module in the series was too basic but at least there was a lot of coding involved. This (second) module didn't even have that.",1
5690,"I was really disappointed with this course, especially considering how great the first course was. IMO...there was too large of a jump between the two courses, and the plethora of ""I'm totally lost..."" threads in the forums would seem to back up my opinion. I'm currently reading Head First Android Development and it is exactly what I needed to grasp basic concepts as well get my bearings in the Android world. If this class remains the same I wouldn't be surprised to see attendance drop in further courses and/or Coursera starts receiving complaints about the difficulty.",1
5691,"Overall it is OK, but the example framework is more like created for teach purpose which is not practical in industry. Moreover, it seems there are many incorrect part in the assignment especially optional code assignments.",3
5692,Great course!,5
5693,Lots of details and references,5
5694,I found it a bit peculiar that there were no tasks (problem sets) that were actually required to be taken (and passed obviously) to receive this course's certificate - which kind of devalues the obtainment of such in my opinion as passing the course by taking quizzes only seems a bit easy to me. Also the whole presentation of the material seemed not as thoroughly thought through - compared to other moocs I have taken or even the first course of this specialization. Although I must admit once you totally got around the fact that this mooc relies heavily on supplementary learning material (I for one bought the ebook mentioned in the course - the busy coder's guide to android development - which is an excellent book and I probably would not have found out about without this mooc) and one gets used to it's approach it is not as bad. Altogether I have to say the course was no waste of my time since I certainly did learn a lot but it could use some honing on a few sides. On an absolute positive side I feel the urge to mention the case studies conclusively which were really eye opening if analysed alongside the mentioned ebook and doing some googling :) Looking forward to course number 3 of this specialization.,4
5695,It was I nice course but it would have been better start building an app from scratch in the practice sections,4
5696,The course is a very good introductory course. The instructor explains the concepts in detail and with nice and clear examples.,5
5697,Good Stuff,5
5698,"very inspirational, useful in many industry and with lots of references. project management support and managerial role inspiration",5
5699,Thank you so much for such a great opportunity! I loved the course and it was very interesting to listen to your lectures.,5
5700,Fantastic!!! a must do course for any aspiring innovators.,5
5701,Awesome course with a very useful framework and very practical examples. Strongly recommended.,5
5702,"Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor. The peer assignments don't work well compared to other Coursera courses. I submitted my assignments in time, but even after a month I still don't have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the 'completion' of my course. When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses?! In addition, you can't participate in the forum discussions until you submit something yourself. I would prefer to add to a thread than go in blind to each forum",4
5703,This course gives good perspective on innovation process and how to bring idea to life. However it was disappointing to me that content of the course has nothing to do with Art and Culture.,1
5704,very good content,5
5705,good pre course for learning any language,5
5706,I really enjoyed the problems. I would strongly advise to solve them all.,5
5707,"Awesome course. Great exercises (although can be frustratingly challenging at times!) Divide and conquer and dynamic programming new to me, have learned a lot. Highly recommended!",5
5708,Great course! The programming assignments are very helpful in understanding the topics in the course. It would be better if the threshold to pass the assignment is increased to 50% or more.,5
5709,Problems are very helpful. Testing system of the grader is superior.,5
5710,Great course! Interesting and useful.,5
5711,The lectures and exercises are awesome. I can not believe it I can solve hard problems by myself. Now I'm very confident to talk about algorithms. Thanks creators.,5
5712,Very helpful course,5
5713,It is a great class!,5
5714,Very detailed and thorough discussions about each concept and problem. Great class to challenge yourself with. Enjoyed it immensely. :),5
5715,Not well explained. Do read the resources and spend time on YouTube and stack overflow to understand the concepts. Otherwise definetly a challenge and an interesting course,4
5716,"The only, issue: we does not have the data set to validate our code.",4
5717,"The programming assignments are great, with the right amount of challenge to help fixate the learning.",5
5718,"I would like to give this course worse than a 1 star. The course explanations are very poor. The explanations drag on and make no sense. I had to go to outside sources to make sense of what the videos were discussing, which I felt like defeats the purpose. Why am I paying for something when I have to use other sources to better explain. I would never recommend this course to anyone. Listening to these teachers explain each subject poorly was killing me. I like to learn through examples but what they provide just makes it more confusing and hard to follow. Each instructor got worse and worse! The videos were so hard to watch and the accents made it even more worse! I feel robbed from taking this course. I should have asked for my refund within the first week, but I felt since I was paying, I would stick it out a little longer. You will get a better explanation if you take each subject and youtube the videos on each subject. Very useless course. Hated every week of this course and I wouldn't dare to continue with the full specialization program. It's very sad to hear that this course gets recommended a lot, but it missed it's mark completely.",1
5719,Very good course!! Totally recommended! It takes you from the basics to more advanced topics. They will demonstrate why it's very important know and apply different approaches for algorithmic problems.,5
5720,Solid! Key for anyone wanting that strong computing foundation independent of programming language,5
5721,Very good course for a newbie developers and for refreshing your knowledge.,5
5722,"This is a great introduction to a more formal approach to algorithms and I look forward to the rest of the courses in the specialization. The dynamic programming week was somewhat more difficult than the other weeks, but I think that could be remedied with more visualizations during the lectures.If you're lacking in any basic maths skills, I would recommend running through Khan academy first. Functional notation and series would be especially useful.",5
5723,Excellent lectures and challenging problem sets!,5
5724,very good organized course,4
5725,"I really appreciate the way course contents are selected in each course of the specialization , It really gives a great conceptual clarity of all the topics .I find a bit difficulty in understanding Big O notation so please try to give some more reference to understand it and also provide some general techniques to calculate it from just looking at code.",5
5726,Great class! I learned a lot!,5
5727,"Great exercises. My only complaint is the last 2 weeks, the instructors weren't visual enough. They kept using hand gestures and not enough concrete visualizations of some of the steps. There were a lot of concrete visualizations for the big ideas... but not enough for all the different material and intermediary steps they were trying to teach.",4
5728,"This is a very useful very rich algorithms course, it is one of the best i have ever attended online, i would really recommend this course to any one who wants a challenging algorithms program.",5
5729,A very nice introduction to solving algorithmic problems in general. Liked the fact that testing techniques are emphasized so much.,5
5730,"I don't recommend this course. The lectures barely touch on the topics being taught, you are expected to go learn on your own. I learned more from the free Khan academy than from this course. It would have been worth more buying good literature on algorithms.",1
5731,"The content of the course is so good. However, I think the lecturers can do better job if the have more visualisation for what they are saying. A lot of time, I felt that I couldn't follow what they was saying and then, I have to pause the video and look at the pseudo code, it much easier to understand. Btw, thanks a lot for providing such an awesome course.",5
5732,"The best course I have done on Coursera. The authors have put together a great set of lectures and especially programming assignments, which really force you to think about what you are doing rather than go by trial and error. What's more, you can submit these in about a dozen commonly used programming languages so you can practise the language of your choice while learning about algorithms. Highly recommended!",5
5733,Awesome course with very interesting practical exercises.,5
5734,This is an exceptionally good course. I thank my instructors for their effort. Thank You.,5
5735,The best course for learning coding.,5
5736,It was an awesome experience and this course is all one needs to get good at algortihms.,5
5737,Very useful,5
5738,"good course, thank you very much.",5
5739,Very interesting topic. Hard push,5
5740,"the course is very good , the best part is implementing the algorithm ,this will give you deep understanding of the algorithm also it will force you to improve your programming skills if you are a beginner , it was very useful for me .",5
5741,"Great course to follow along, I love how the homework assignments have the input template already in place so you can focus on the algorithm",4
5742,wonderful!!!cool coding problems,5
5743,This was my first taste of algorithm design--I loved it! The course was challenging but just easy enough for me to get through in an unfamiliar language.,5
5744,Very good design of course. It seems simple at the beginning but later very useful.,5
5745,"The course is a great first course on algorithmic toolbox. I love the way the toolbox serves as a precursor to the more involved courses. In particular, the topic of stress testing is something that MOOCs don't cover in general and lead me to give up in my earlier MOOCs.All in all, great job professors Sascha, Daniel, Neil, Michael and Pavel.You guys are awesome.",5
5746,"I liked the course - it has very good balance, with some challenging tasks, but not too hard for smart learner. Good job! Getting 100% grade was fun.On other side minimal passing grade is a joke. You can literally get the certificate simply by implementing given pseudo-code in language of your choice. It hugely devalues the certificate, especially so without Honor track and no ""with distinction"" certificate offered.",4
5747,Course covers most of the classic algorithms problems. There should have been final exam.,4
5748,"The course was awesome ..The content ,the problems were all thought provoking - couple of times i had issues understanding the language of the instructor , sans that it is a very very good course and a must take i would say",4
5749,"Awesome course - one of my favorites I've done on Coursera. It's thorough yet clear. I also like that you can pass the course just by implementing the algorithms as shown in the lectures, but then each assignment has multiple additional problems which challenge you to think for yourself. Really great course design!",5
5750,1 professor just did not make sense to me. do not just read out the pseudo code but instead try to visually show whats happening step by step with arrows and calculations from scratch,3
5751,It is amazing course. It presents the toolbox in a sequence of incremental levels to help you completely understand each level.,5
5752,Great and challenging course.,5
5753,Pretty good course and refresher. Enjoyed working through the problems.,5
5754,"superb programming assignments, created sophisticated logic for solving high edge problems using O(log n) or O(n logn) complexity, this was very challenging and nice course",5
5755,"The videos and explanations are very poor. Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script, and everything feels fake. By reading off a script they are forced to ""hand-wave"" and do not explain concepts covered completely.The only thing I liked about this course were the problem sets, which were interesting to do. Will not buy rest of specialization, feels like this is just a cash cow for UCSD.",2
5756,"Very Good courseAll the concepts were explained very well, barring Dynamic Programming. That could have been a bit more detailed. The programming assignments were fun to solve. A must have course for people beginning their study in computer science.",4
5757,"Great course - the problem sets were challenging and appropriate for the learning goals. For participants who have not been exposed to significant mathematical coursework, the mathematical notation may be intimidating at first, but is not an insurmountable obstacle.",5
5758,Lots to learn and a great course.,5
5759,"Very informative. I am a self-taught programmer, and this definitely helps with the programmer's mindset. Definitely challenging.",5
5760,Really nice experience for me . I enjoyed it,4
5761,"I liked the fact that the algorithms are not just the introductory searching and sorting algorithms. The assignments are fairly difficult (I have decent scripting experience), but not impossibly so.",5
5762,Nice materials and challenging problems!,5
5763,"Informative, with minimal theory - it is plus for me, because allow save time. Some tasks is not easy :)",5
5764,everything is great exept last week,4
5765,Lectures are very confusing. Instructors should use white boarding to explain codes. Difficult to follow them.,3
5766,The materials covered are not enough to fully explore the topics. Should include much more detailed explanations especially when explaining some of the complex algorithms.,3
5767,Tasks are amazing. But sometimes had to google some extra help.,5
5768,The core concepts are very well explained,5
5769,Pretty informative and helps you refresh the basics.,4
5770,Very good course! But expensive.,4
5771,Thanks for this awesome course. It helped me a lot to improve my theoretical knowledge in building complex solutions based on different approaches.,5
5772,"Lectures and quizzes are okay, assignments are great to make you think deeper about the topics. I have to agree with a lot of the other course takers that you get very little help from the teaching staffs. However, I do feel that the discussion forums are enough to help you through all of the programming tasks.Programming assignments aren't really friendly to Haskell's list, and vectors are not available. If you use Haskell, you'll be forced to work with arrays or sequences, which are not as nice.",4
5773,This is a fantastic course. Great material well supplemented by assignments.,5
5774,Learnt so much! Great content.,5
5775,"The course content is very good and is must have if you missed that stuff in colledge. It teaches of algorithmic analysis so you know which algorithm is more efficient, gives some examples of cool techniques and provides challenges to apply those techniques.However, there are things that I hate about this course. First of all this is about forums. They are broken down into sessions and there are too little people on each session. Staff provides exactly zero help. If you are stuck, you have no hope on these forums and will need to find help somewhere else.Programming assignments are great, they are relevant, interesting, challenging and the automatic grader system estimates not only if we get the correct answer but also the efficiency of our algorithm. There have been some problems in divide and conquer section though. I've been struggling with implementing binary search (which is quite a simple algorithm!) in JavaScript to pass the assignment for weeks. I've written and rewritten it in different ways, done hundreds of manual and automated tests, posted on course forums (receiving zero answers) and have gotten the same error again and again. I was able to solve this only by switching to Python. I am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case, which cost me hours and hours. Overall, the programming assignments are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worse.I do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails. Perhaps, if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programmer but I felt more like it was wasting of our time. The main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why, it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding anger,Some lecturers have a strong Russian accent, that is very distracting. It is not a lot of work to take some English pronunciation training before making a course, isn't it?Overall, I enrolled for the specialization and planned to buy it in full but bought only this course to start with. Now I am glad I did that because now I am not sure about buying the other courses and will look somewhere else first.Anyway, the creators of the course have done a great job, which is highly appreciated. I believe you can make this course much better by fixing the issues I pointed above.",4
5776,Everything was super. Extremely useful course.,5
5777,Really iam so so so happy :) this course is the best course i met before :) <3 <3 <#,5
5778,"Very good course. It illustrates many algorithms using simple ways, short videos and readable material.",4
5779,Good content . And very good assignments.,5
5780,Nice course with meticulous instructions,5
5781,This course covers important aspects of techniques used to solve popular problems. But it misses to cover introductory points in some modules (i.e: dynamic programming module) as well as the accent of some instructors isn't clear enough.,3
5782,great course,5
5783,i don't know how to say thanks to you,5
5784,This course is the basic of specialization and helped a lot to understand algorithms in a better way. Thanks so much to are the teachers,5
5785,Awesome. Learnt many things.,5
5786,"Nice and tough course. Make sure to plan ahead for the homework if you expect to complete all of the assignments above and beyond what is required. After finishing the course I switched my session to the next one so that I would be able to complete all the extra assignments. It can be tough juggling this class if you work full time, and have other projects outside of work that demand your time.",4
5787,"Great course. I would suggest to improve pronunciation of some of the lecturers, add more material, lower the concentration of the material (by prolonging or splitting the course). Great work, thanks!",4
5788,Very helpful course! Goes over a lot of concepts I see come up with Comp Sci a,5
5789,Interesting and challenging!,5
5790,it was a really good course..i had learned a lot from this course.:),4
5791,It was quite interesting .,5
5792,Great course! I've learnt a lot and have deeper understanding of algorithm. Thank you!,5
5793,Great place to start,5
5794,"I really had a hard time understanding Dynamic Programming. I recoomend to remove this topic and focus more on solidifying foundations so that students can be more prepared for moving through the whole Algorithm Courses. I never heard of this topic before and the lecturer ommited many steps when explaining the Edit Distance. I was forced to look for other resources like Open Courseware Algorithms course, and this is how could understand what was dynamic programming easily. Hope this helps!",3
5795,Great Class,5
5796,"Very good and challenging course. Gets tougher as it progresses. Less support from the staff and the community, but proper content and explanation in the videos.",4
5797,"I think that some assignations are too difficult, and some indeed few explanations are poor",4
5798,good concepts aree taught,5
5799,Great class for students with some elementary programming background who are eager to learn the fundamentals of algorithm design.,5
5800,The overall course was very good however the edit distance lectures were very fast to grasp the concepts,4
5801,"Homework was very nice, but strong accent of lecturers impeded me",3
5802,"Instructors are perfect. The course is intense and not easy. But the way the concepts are taught is very lucid. One of the best courses on coursera. I am leading my way to the specialization. Again, the instructors are really great. The assignments are the best part of this course. Must take.",5
5803,"It's really insightful, It would be great if the test cases for each problems, shared with the student.Thank you!",5
5804,"Nice course! Definitely, I have learned a lot. To be all honesty, I find myself sleeping sometimes during the lectures =)",5
5805,Awesome course. Well explained with lots of examples.The must see if interested about the basics of algorithmic.,5
5806,I like the assignments provided in the course,5
5807,"Really enjoyable, and a good learning curve",5
5808,"A good course , programming assignments are also good , even the discussion forums are good. Tutorials are wonderful everything is explained very clearly and hints are given at each point overall good for computer science undergrad.",5
5809,"Def a useful skills to have when starting to interview for jobs. This is a hard course to teach to begin with. I found the lectures really boring, too long, hard to understand and just not really motivated well. I think the homework problem are good, but they are very time consuming. You need to use various methods to find edges cases and though that might be a good skill to have as well, it's just too much to get done in one week and somewhat frustrating when you're only stuck in one test case. I think this could be an excellent course with a few modification on the slides and adding more motivations and making shorter homework problems that focuses on the main part of the material for that as oppose to things we've already covered in the previous week. At the moment, I don't think I'll continue this specialization the way it's designed.",1
5810,A great course for beginners. I learnt a lot of new things from the course especially the really efficient and much needed algorithmic techniques. Had great fun!!,5
5811,A little light on the theory,3
5812,Great Course. A lot thanks to all instructors.,5
5813,"Congratulations for this well-designed, informative and extremely educative course! The language agnostic way of presenting and explaining these basic but important algorithmic techniques provides an extremely useful way to better understand and further elaborate these methods by using the programming language of our choice. Of course, some programming experience in at least one language is needed, but this course can also provide a great lab to start learning others. The programming assignments and the way you have designed them (time/memory constraints) are ideal to learn designing these algorithmic techniques correctly and efficiently.",5
5814,Awesome course. Cannot recommend it more highly,5
5815,I think this course is pretty interesting!,5
5816,Thank you very much! I am looking forward to joining the second course of the specialization.,5
5817,"At my country I was dropped of the final year computer engineering and automatic control at engineering faculty due to health and financial conditions, with online courses I have the chance to prove what I can do, Thank you very much !!",5
5818,"Amazing course! Highly recommended to everyone. I've actually taken an algorithms course in university, and this one is much better!",5
5819,"Alexander Kulikov, Michel Levin and Neil Rhodes are awesome teachers. Every topic of this course opens a whole new dimension of concept. It was awesome.",4
5820,Very useful for well understanding basic algorithm method!,5
5821,"Great course, however some assignment are really difficult and the forum seems not very helpful.",4
5822,Programming assignments are well structured in such a way that it encourages one to continuously improve upon the solution.,4
5823,I was great! A lot of useful and interesting tasks to improve your skills.,5
5824,Well presented material. Good pace od lectures - short but fully understandable. Different instructors (you won't get bored ;)). Very good programming assigments.,5
5825,Awesome!!! Thanks to all instructors.,5
5826,"Explanation could have been more clear, especially for polynomial multiplication.",4
5827,"I had already done ""Algorithms: Design and Analysis Part 1"", so this course was not as good as that one.This course had lot of programming questions, which I find very good to have for any course. I just hope next courses of the specialization will be beneficial for my career.",3
5828,This course is designed with a lot of thought behind it and using basically every mainstream programming language makes it even more fun to participate.,5
5829,Bad teaching quality.,2
5830,"The course brings a lot of knowledge for me, help me to improve the expertise and foreign language teachers are very easy to understand, clear pronunciation",5
5831,An excellent course. The video lectures are brief but explain the main points very well. The assignments are very well organised.,5
5832,"Very well structured, good choice of content. All video lectures are engaging and you can feel a lot of though was put into making algorithms explanations both clear and concise. Many thanks to the lecturers.",5
5833,An exception and resourceful course from best instructors n teachers globally.I am glad to be a part of this.,5
5834,"Awesome explanation, very concise.",5
5835,The course is great,4
5836,"Overall is good course with many exercises, forum is supportive, however mentors/instructors never answered my questions (i guessed they bothered only with the very first session when course was launched) Language is sometimes overly complicated and hard to grasp the main principles of the algorithm (e.g. dynamic programming week 5) I watched youtube to understand same ideas but explained in much simpler way.",3
5837,very cool,5
5838,"I found the assignments challenging in the absolute best sense of the term, and therefore incredibly rewarding as well! Whenever I've gotten stuck, the answer was always in the course material somewhere, even if I didn't see it there at first. The discussion forums were extremely helpful, and I was astounded to see that that instructors were still actively monitoring the discussion forums and responding to student questions. I'm obviously not an expert in this field, but I've been an educator before, and my own impression of the assignments was that they were extremely well designed: it was impossible to pass them without knowing what you were doing, the tools to approach them were always found in the lectures, and the challenge problems pushed your knowledge even farther. I would recommend the specialization to everyone. Additionally, I noticed that the content aligns well with other DS&A syllabi I have seen in brick-and-mortar institutions, especially the first 3 or 4 courses. It's also a very nice luxury to be able to submit in Python. I have certainly learned a great deal.",5
5839,"If one has taken the Algorithms 1 and 2 course by Profs. Sedgewick and Wayne, this course will be a disappointment and waste of time.",1
5840,"I like the course structure and material. It starts off easy enough to get you interested and then throws at you challenges at early stage, if you are up for it.What I don't like is video session itself, some of instructors talk too fast and dwell much into topic, assuming you understood everything. And as way to composite that, they offer a ""resource"" links to help you understand.Then some of them have ""hard"" accent, it's really difficult to follow them even for native speaker, yet alone for those whose English is second language.Now exercise and assignments are spot on but you are forced to relay on other sources to grasp everything. I doubt anyone taking this course has not reached for ""outer"" help at least once.",4
5841,Really Useful Content.,5
5842,"great course, covers the basic algorithms and techniques thoroughly. great for someone who is just starting in the field of algorithms.",5
5843,"The accent from teachers would be a little bit annoying, also the fact that most of the topics (incomes, outcomes from the programs) are unclear for a naive student. But for the rest, is a great way to introduce programming.",4
5844,Solutions are explained with too much detail. You should give the student a chance to learn by herself.,5
5845,the material are great so much information and it is the first from the hole specializationbut! the explanation is so weak doesn't match at all with this big datathe pseudocode is so distracting and hard to readi always get lost and i don't know is it an array in the code or variable and what does he want to do with itthe pseudocode should be just a normal english code saying what to donot an understandable signs :\i am really sad that i couldn't get benefits from this amount of knowledge,2
5846,"Good collection of task and learning materials. Definitely worth it! More numbers theory and algorithms reading could be included. But agree, it better to read books referenced.Thank you!",4
5847,Overall this was a good course. Some of the presenters need to work on their presentation skills (personally I had no problems with the accents). I also felt that the sections on dynamic programming seemed a bit rushed and I needed to spend a bit of time researching this on third parties before I felt comfortable completing the exercises.The grading system was really cool and the exercises seemed well thought-out and thorough. I'd recommend this course to existing developers without a computer science background. Those who want more mathematical rigour should look into the Tim Roughgarden/Stanford course.,4
5848,Some features of this course are too good like Dynamic Programming. Thanks for helping me out .,5
5849,"Great course! Helped me a lot, courses taught this well keep me motivated!",5
5850,It`s a very good course that covers some of the most fundamental concepts behind algorithms!,5
5851,Very good subject and very good topics presented. Professors are very good. And the video presentation is awesome.,5
5852,"I found the course to have some really helpful approaches to solving algorithmic problems when test inputs are unknown. Great ""Toolbox"" for a programmer.",4
5853,A great and exciting start for the Specialization,5
5854,Awesome start! Loved the programming assignments!,5
5855,"To complete this course you should be familiar with programming. While the first weeks are relatively easy to follow, last ones are really hard to keep up with.",4
5856,"Overall I like this course. The beginning of the course was very light and easy to follow. As the concepts got more in-depth, the weeks (namely 4 and 5) felt rushed and somewhat incomplete. Regardless, having never been exposed to this type of material, and for the price, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get their feet wet with algorithms.",4
5857,Loving the course so far! Best balance between theory and practice!,5
5858,"Overall it is a great course, the most challenging part was to understand the optional prove of the Master theorem. I believe that this course and the whole specialization is all about learning not only the mandatory material of the course, but also the whole optional material provided. Thanks to all the instructors for their hard work!",5
5859,Loved the problem in the course.,5
5860,this course is very useful. Every topic is covered here and the assignments were also very effective to check your concept.,5
5861,I learned a lot in this course and it was sufficiently challenging. My only qualm was that some of the pseudo-code was hard to understand and slightly misleading.,4
5862,Good instruction and examples. Easy to understand. So great so far!,5
5863,Great course! Thanks to the instructors!,5
5864,One of th best Courses on Coursera.,5
5865,Very good course. Basic course for Computer Science graduates.,5
5866,"AWESOME course ,A must for any programmer.",5
5867,An excellent and methodical approach to learning algorithms and their related data structures (as well as appreciating the value and importance of efficient computing). Also a great refresher even if you have had formal training in Data Structures and Algorithms.,4
5868,"Near the end it becomes a slosh to get through all the information covered in the last two weeks. It feels like you are given some hints and pointers on what to do, but for the most part, the last two weeks are being tossed in the deep end and hoping you learn how to swim.I want to give a 3.5 but that's not allowed. With the amount of content covered this course is closer to a 4 than a 3.",4
5869,I love the whole explanations and outline... i'd recommend this to me in the next world,5
5870,Thank you for this course.,5
5871,Amazing course about algorithms. Complex things described by common words.,5
5872,I thought this was really helpful for my day to day career as a developer. It helped give me better tools to talk about what I am working on as well as introducing me to some new concepts.,5
5873,"It is a brilliant course, well organized and pretty interesting. However, the problems are not as challenging as one could expect.",4
5874,"This course is well-designed and delivered by the experienced instructors. It is particularly suitable for those who have some basic knowledge in programming (knowing how to use if-else if-else statements, for-loop and while-loop, etc.; knowing a little bit how to write a simple code in C, C++, Python or others) and would like to enhance his programming techniques through polishing his logical thinking ability while he is designing a algorithm.",5
5875,I have solved more problems in this course compared to any other courses. This course has laid foundation to solve more problems in Dynamic Programming. Thank you to the entire team.,5
5876,"As the title suggests, this course will give you some tools/techniques in terms of algorithms design and implementation. You will probably also learn from doing the programming assignments. Enjoy!",4
5877,"I love the fact that this course is language agnostic and really lets you learn about the underlying algorithms that make our software run faster. It is challenging, but definitely worth it if you are fond of a specific language!",5
5878,"Great to lay out the basis of algorithms. Very descriptive and progressive. I enjoyed all the exercises that helped understanding and implementing all the concepts explained in this course.It is also worth mentioning that, towards the end, they offer more advanced algorithms to challenge your newly acquired knowledge.",5
5879,"The course gives a good overview on the algorithms types and problems, but it's cannot be used as standalone source of algorith,s learning. You should use good textbook as well.The programming challenges are really interesting (and challenging), sometimes it took for me a couple of evenings to complete all five week assignments.Thanks!",4
5880,"The content covered in this course is great. However, I hope there was a more efficient way to communicate with student. I hope there is a way to bring student together like a group chat function in the coursera app. So, people who want to be more committed can communicate more often and effcient.",4
5881,"These two stars go to the instructor in week 1. I left the course after week 3 because I couldn't tolerate the accents of the instructors. I got frustrated starting from week 2 where I have to reread the subtitles to understand the material. Please let someone who can speak English fluently teach the course, please. The course goes kinds of fast, this is first course of the Specialization and it quickly jumps to Greedy algorithm, really? In general Algorithm course, it is usually taught late.",2
5882,"The problem sets are great and probably worth the price, but the lectures become very hard to follow after week 3 and the discussion forums are very disorganized - it's hard to find useful information. Some of the lectures have slides available, some don't; some of the lectures have somewhat-useful subtitles/transcripts, others have incomprehensible garbled messes (I don't know if they're machine-generated or just transcribed by someone with no understanding of the material/vocabulary - logarithm != algorithm!).I really like the problem sets, but some of the lectures are pretty rough, just a guy talking in front of some pseudocode for 10 minutes. The instructors seem friendly and engaging, though.",3
5883,Great course! I really enjoyed taking it. I think it is very challenging and it definitly updates your algorithmic's skills and changes your thnking,5
5884,Good introduction to algorithms !,5
5885,My programming and algorithm design greatly improved after taking this course. Through the advanced problem sets I was able to appreciate the finer aspects of efficient algorithm designing and I'm sure that I'll improve a lot with courses to come.I would definitely recommend this course to any one who wishes to improve his/her skill set for designing efficient algorithms.,5
5886,The ideas I learned about the classical algorithms and their run-times are really useful and interesting. The problems are also very good.,5
5887,Learned a lot.The notions of testing and debugging really inspired me.,5
5888,lots of mathematics and it's challenging,4
5889,"The dynamic programming classes could be really improved, but, overall, a solid course.",4
5890,"Everything is awesome except a minor mismatch between Niel Rhodes's and Alexander Kulikov's presentations in Week 4. Although Prof. Rhodes prooved Master Theorem in the first half of the Week, Prof. Kulikov didn't use it estimating algorithms asymtotics.",4
5891,All the material was relevant to algorithms and the advance problem were very challengingA must Do course for those who are interested in algorithms designthank you coursera and its team,5
5892,"Awesome course, awesome algorithms!",5
5893,"The course material is very good indeed, but some of the instructors were somewhat difficult to understand because of strong accents. Subtitles were largely inaccurate.",4
5894,"Once they dig into the material, the difficulty ramps up, and it's absolutely worth it!",4
5895,The full course should be available with the assignments for the non payers. Only the certificate of this should be provided to those who have paid.,4
5896,Dynamic Programming need to be stronger,4
5897,"Basic algorithms, explained very clearly, great and helpful homeworks",5
5898,"Really challenging, starts easy but gets heavy and time consuming after 3rd week.Be prepared to study additional material and spend some hours cracking the weekly assignments. Satisfying when you accomplish it. Maybe a good idea could be to combine algorithms and data structures and separate in 2 courses Algo & Data Structures 1, and Algo & DS 2.I feel, a better knowledge of DS could have help me to solve the Algo assignements faster.",4
5899,"Excellent quality, loved the quizzes and graded assignments, completely worth the time and money! Highly recommend!",5
5900,Very Good course. Best to prepare for campus placement tests.,5
5901,"Explanations were thorough, and the problem sets helped me gain a better understanding of the concepts with challenging but doable problem sets.",5
5902,"very well designed course ,very helpful.",4
5903,I like it very very much. I would like to recommend this course to all of my friends.,5
5904,It's a great course which helped me in a greater extent to enhance my concept in Algorithm.,5
5905,This course was a great introduction to algorithms. I am a novice programmer at best and had little to no knowledge about algorithms before this course. The concepts and programming assignments were challenging and I did not finish all of them the way I would have liked to but the challenge has made me more knowledgeable and a slightly better coder. Thank you. I will be taking data structures next.,5
5906,"Loved the course, and the way the teachers taught! Learnt a lot of new things!",5
5907,"Nice course, learned a lot from it.",5
5908,This course is awesome,5
5909,"Algorithmic Toolbox consists of a series of slides containing slimmed down explanations on introductory algorithmic concepts, followed up with programming assignments. The slides are the centrepiece of the course, as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode they're comprised of.I learned a lot during this course. Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning. Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations.Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge. This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.All material is left equally weighted. Rather than providing explanations like: ""We don't need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on. Reference this chapter in this book for more detail."" presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on. I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.In terms of communication ability, the presenters don't hold up against many of the free/low-cost services I'm accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc. Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers. But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one. Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard. Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity I've come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy. After a couple weeks into the course, I just went straight to the slides, read MIT's Introduction to Algorithms, and skipped most of the course videos.But all things considered, the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts, regardless of where I sought it out.",2
5910,Great Course...especially for someone who doesn't have a CSE background but is immensely interested in learning it,5
5911,Clear explanation!,5
5912,Some of the best course i have ever enrolled in...!!!!,5
5913,Pretty Nice,5
5914,Great course. I enjoy it.,4
5915,Learn some new and very interesting things. It covered my doubts as well.,5
5916,"First four weeks of the course were awesome,some exciting problems,insightful teaching but fifth week's content I felt were not up to the standards of first four weeks.Nonetheless it was great experience.Thank you instructors and course forum.",4
5917,nicely managed enjoyed learning,5
5918,Great course. The team is doing a great work improving it all the time and the grading system and lecture are really good as well.,5
5919,"Excellent coverage of algorithmic techniques in this course, with very accessible introductions to such fundamental topics as the Master Method, greedy algorithm design, and dynamic programming. This class hits the sweet spot for people who find Tim Roughgarden's Analysis and Design of Algorithms course too intense and hand-wavy, but who still want mathematically-sound, proof-based discussion of algorithmic techniques. (Listen to Roughgarden's drive-by treatment of Karatsuba's algorithm in his first week of lectures, and you will appreciate Neil Rhodes' coverage of the same algorithm all the more.) You get an introduction to a lot of ""greatest hits"" from Computer Science, but at a level where you come away understanding the technique. The problem sets start off with fairly easy exercises, just enough to reinforce your understanding, and progress up to exercises that will prove challenging indeed to newcomers. You will get a lot out of careful study of this course. I look forward to continuing in this specialization.",5
5920,very helpful,5
5921,"Extremely useful course, that will improve your understanding of the core algorithmic techniques.",5
5922,Very clear introduction to algorithm basics. Reasonable quizzes and assignments.,5
5923,great teaching and challenging problems,5
5924,A well thought out course. Amazing teachers. Thorough assignments. Helped a lot.,5
5925,"I took this course as part of the specialization and find it to be an excellent refresher of what I learned in undergraduate and graduate Computer Science classes (which were solely theoretical, and I had little chances to code algorithms/data structures). Finally, in this course, I could implement what I learned before and now.Not a perfect course - lectures could be improved (pseudo code at times takes efforts to understand). But assignments are amazing and comfortably challenging. The vast choice of programming languages is a feature. Make sure that you write automated unit-tests for your solutions. This will reduce your debugging efforts.Thanks!",5
5926,"Very straight forward, this course comes from the basics and completes the theory with practice to ensure learning. 100% recommended for those who are not familiar with algorithms or those who want to have practice implementing and coding.",5
5927,Great assignments -- Keep up the good work guys!,4
5928,"A great course in its own right but it also fills a void between the ""Learn <programming language>"" and using programming languages to analyze Big Data. The instructors have put together an excellent introduction to the wonderful, and scary, world of algorithms. I must admit I was ready to send my PC flying through the window on numerous occasions when I could not get my particular implementation of an algorithm to run within the time AND memory limits set by the instructors. More so, because often you are not told what particular test case made it fail. In the end, I believe this is a great approach to have learners really dive into the material and think about the various run times before submitting a particular solution. Well worth while your time!",5
5929,This course is very good to start algorithmic coding.,5
5930,Very nice course!,5
5931,Another one of Coursera's trademark course. Really awesome for beginners in Algorithms.,5
5932,nice stress testing is now i am learned,4
5933,"I agree with some of the reviews here. It's fantastic at the beginning of the course. Towards the end, unfortunately the professor's accent is heavy and sometimes difficult to understand. The subtitles don't help either because they were auto-generated. My brain had to take extra cognitive workload to decipher what was actually said before trying to understand the materials on the slides and everything else. I also didn't like the way index 0 and 1 is mixed in different lectures. Why shouldn't we stay consistent in pseudocode using index starting with either 0 or 1? The slides are confusing regarding this matter especially when you translate algorithms into code.Nonetheless, I liked the assignments overall. The course's instructors included some of very interesting problems and indeed helped understand the lessons better. I also liked the course structure and the carefully prepared slides.",3
5934,So awesome. The challenges were great and I learned a lot!,5
5935,"This is a good course, and I liked the quality of video lectures. The material is structured and lets the students understand the basic approaches they can follow to solve algorithmic tasks.Also a good plus is that there are assignments. First, they are of different complexity - so anyone will find an interesting task there. Second, there are prepared starter files for 3 languages - so you spend time working on algos, not on bootstrapping projects. And third - grading is automatic.Just for fiuture - as a more engaging thing there could be also made tasks to review of other people's assignments (as it is done in other courses) and implementing a test case which makes a wrong solution to fail (which is something like TopCoder does). But this idea is too raw and needs more thinking.",5
5936,"Update: As I proceed to wk 5, I know why there are some complaint on Dynamic programming,Reduced to 2 stars. Lectures are totally useless for the assignment,The course is really good until week 4 when it deteriorates very quick. No matter how many times I re-watch the lecture, I can't understand much. I ended up using wikipedia for the quiz instead :PI can't use much of the course forum since there are too many posts there and it keep crashing my chrome.This course gets my 3 stars from the first 3 weeks alone, otherwise it gonna be 0-2 stars.",2
5937,Love how clear the professors explain the not-so-straighforward context. I enjoyed every single moment. The assignments constitute the biggest part of understanding and learning.,5
5938,"Testing cases are claimed to be generated randomly, in that way why can't we get the random test case to improve our result? Also, there is no example code after the course, if I didn't solve out the problem I may never have the chance to work it out.",4
5939,"Very good content and great professors, I like the short duration of lectures and more emphasis on assignments..",5
5940,Algorithm Toolbox is an awesome course for getting started with problem thinking and problem solving!,5
5941,"I would've never forced myself to learn to think recursively if it weren't for this course. As someone from a mechanical engineering discipline, with a minimal background in java programming, i was able to following along with this course and complete all assignments. The discussion boards and professor's lectures were particularly helpful along with the fact that I could download everything for viewing offline.",5
5942,Very detailed and well covered,5
5943,More information should be given for the failed test cases. Is a waste of time to find bug if you don't know what the bug is. ie test case 4/13 in the minimal dot product assignment,4
5944,"I always wanted to improve the algorithms and data structures field. The books wasn't so efficient. Especially they weren't so practical. These courses are the first courses where I really got a lot of knowledge. Especially because of assignments. All lectors are very good in explanation of the material and tell many additional useful things. These courses are the really good base, after which you can open the books related to algorithms and read more details if you needed.I am definitely going to complete the whole specialization!The only thing which was not convenient for me is that both courses Algorithmic Toolbox and Data Structures are started at the same time. It was difficult to find out the time for both courses and spend enough time to solve all assignments instead of only enough for passing.Anyway, now I am started the second iteration of the course and I am going to solve all assignments which I skipped.Big thanks to Daniel, Alex, Pavel, Neil and Mike!Regards,Sergey",5
5945,"Even though this course covers a lot fundamentals for introduction to algorithm, the course itself is not designed as good as I expected. For starters, the weekly problem designs aren't very good. Some problem statements are ambiguous and not very clear unless you read more than one time or take a closer look at the examples. Often, the input format/arguments are designed to take redundant info. Some problem even has more than one possible correct outputs, which is just confusing for learning purpose.In terms of lecture videos, it's good that there are some classic algorithm problems being demonstrated in the video, however the linkage between how to express a problem in mathematical languages is poorly explained. For example, in the lecture of edit distance, the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all. I personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures, however I personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience (I also understand that it's more difficult to explain proving steps). Considering the large variety of audience, I would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more in-depth knowledge into optional videos, in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs, meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better. Overall, I know that talking and analyzing algorithms can be kinda of boring and challenging, but I wish the course videos could be stated in a more interesting and intriguing way.",2
5946,Thanks for explaining very clearly the basic concepts.,5
5947,Great course to understand different categories of Algorithms and which one to apply to solve a problem,5
5948,"This course works on fundamental approaches, like divide and conquer, greedy algorithms and takes us to the more advanced dynamic approach which is ubiquitous and drives most of the modern applications.Really beneficial to solve problems on a day to day basis.",5
5949,hard but great,5
5950,"Excellent material and very well explained, thank you so much for the opportunity",5
5951,"Feedback in assignment is not good enough.For example, for the points and segment, there are no correct answer in output as a reference.",2
5952,It is a great course. But explanation could be made simpler in proof part of the course.,4
5953,Really enjoying it.,5
5954,"The course starts very promising, but it gets worse week after week, culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming. That’s when I gave up and decided to write this review instead, with just one assignment missing to complete the course.Some of the teachers aren’t native english speakers, which is fine, but their english is very hard to understand. I found myself having to watch some portions of the videos over and over again in order to understand what was being said. I tried reading the transcripts instead, but the they’re even worse! It seems that they were automatically generated from the videos, thus suffering with the poor pronunciation.The teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary, but to be fair, they do mention it on the FAQ as part of the necessary background. However, even though it’s an online course, they barely use any teaching method besides very raw slides, some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content. The only resources offered to help learning are a few open source visualizations. I expected much more.The only good aspect from this course are the assignment checkers, which allow you to write your solutions in multiple languages.I deeply regret the money and time I spent on this course.",2
5955,Very good lectures and programming assignments.,5
5956,Gives you very good insight into Algorithms basics that gets you going great with advanced courses.,5
5957,Indeed a very nice course to start learning about different kinds of algorithms.,5
5958,That was such an informative course,5
5959,"Videos are very well explained, the exercises comes with several difficulties, good to apply what you learn and push a bit more. I was able to retake some stuff that I've forgotten and learn new stuff. As a 12 year experienced engineer, I'm please that I took this course.",4
5960,Great Course,5
5961,The weekly assignments are well designed and interesting,5
5962,This is awesome and problems are challenging which pushes me towards my goal.,5
5963,"the content if very good, but lecturers are terrible. you better read slides and read any book you like. watching their videos it wast of time.",4
5964,"It's not too much work. For someone who wants to take programming classes online but also may have a variant amount of time, this course is perfect.",5
5965,"I finished the first session of Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques, the Algorithmic Toolbox course. This is an amazing course. To review why this course (and series) is awesome:1) 25 + programming assignments, ranging from easy to advanced.2) Unlike many other CS courses, this course allows multiple programming languages. You have choices of C C++, Java, Python2, Python3. They may add more to the list :).3) Super active forum, the learners come here to debate approaches and share knowledge a lot. There were so many times I'm convinced my algorithm can't be optimized anymore, then another guy came in with another genius idea.4) Plus, the instructor, Mr. Alex S. Kulikov is a super nice guy, he made 300+ forum posts in the first session alone, to guide learners thoroughly.Comprehensive grader: grades you on correctness, time use, memory use. You have no choice but to optimize all 3 aspects to pass.This course has premium access. However, both the quality and quantity are well worth the price. You can read other learners' comments and many agree with this.",5
5966,Good course.But I wish there was a final assignment which covered all the weeks like a module exam to revise what we have learnt in all 4 weeks,4
5967,Currently in my Week 2 of the Course and I have to say I absolutely enjoyed Week 1! My expectations are now even higher for week 2 and further. A great introduction to a critical topic and the best part was that I found myself completely involved to the course until I successfully submitted my assignment. Cheers!,5
5968,"Good coverage of the material, with several videos dedicated to individual topics, accompanied with complementing problem sets which have a decent selection of semi-optional advanced problems.",5
5969,I love programming assignments in this course!,5
5970,great leacture! thank youand keep it free for video except certification,5
5971,"Lectures were clear, for the most part, and the homeworks were fun and instructive. Material on dynamic programming might have been clearer. Also, notes and references to texts would have been helpful. Thanks for putting together a great course.",4
5972,"Very instructive and informative, helps resolving many doubts.Excellent examples and programming assignments, information provided by autograder is just about right.I feel like the programming assignment is just a tad too relaxing, for dynamic programming for example, I think we need to complete 3 out of 5 in order to pass, not just two.",4
5973,This is a great primer for algorithms and goes one step further than similar courses I've taken by introducing dynamic programming.,5
5974,Good. Waiting for session to began.,4
5975,"Having time left on the last programming assignment in week 4 and not being allowed to complete it was a downer. I'm not sure if this was bug or if I'm missing something. The course was great and challenging. Thank you for preparing, organizing and teaching this course.",4
5976,"This is an awesome Course. I'd like that the failed tests, of the submitted programs, to be shown, in order to have a better idea where you are doing wrong.",4
5977,"I really think this is a good course, but some of them is hard to understand for me as beginner.",4
5978,A very good introduction to Algorithmic techniques. Well worth the cost of entry!,5
5979,Good Algorithms are taken together .,5
5980,Very Good. Waiting new courses~,5
5981,"The best online class I've taken so far: not only because of the clear explanation and easy-to-follow videos, but also the effort the professors have put int answering most of the questions, especially Prof. Alex. He almost answered more than half of the questions within short amount of time. This is very rarely seen in other moocs.",5
5982,Good Course,5
5983,"Very clear in explanations, I learnt a lot of new cool stuff.Assignments aren't always so trivial but there's always a hint to help in solving them",5
5984,I enjoyed the course a lot and would recommend it to anyone who's getting their feet wet in the world of algorithms.,5
5985,Really Great for any serious developer who is willing to break grounds,5
5986,"very excited, thanks :)",5
5987,Excellent course with tons of exercises and interesting lectures.,5
5988,Excellent course!! Thanks a lot!!,5
5989,Amazing Course. I have been looking for this kind of course for months.Must for anyone who wants to be good in Competitive Programming and Algorithms,5
5990,"Very good course on algorithms,particularly useful for competitive programming.",5
5991,"good course with some very nice idea. I like the fact you can use a lot of languages for you programming assesment, the content is really helpful, I would like to have more indications from the grading system to save time.",4
5992,"This course does more then just teaching algorithms. It gives you insights and ideas that you can later use to build new algorithms. Personally, I think this is crucial, cause it helps you to build unique skill - reasoning about unknown problems.",5
5993,"If you want to learn more about both theoretical and practical computer science, do this specialization. I'm completely sold on this specialization after one week. The instructors are extremely helpful and have a high level of clarity both in the videos, and on the forums. The language semi-agnosticism is excellent! The forums are active and friendly! You will hit the ground learning right away with this specialization!This course has so far motivated me immensely to delve further in to my software engineering education. I did not get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, just an Associate's. Though I work in the industry, I wanted to do programming competitions and personal projects to make up for the lack of experience with the ideas and implementation of algorithms and their data structures.This course has jump-started my journey beyond my current abilities, and I believe it will do the same for you. If you're even remotely thinking you would be interested in taking these courses, do!",5
5994,Very good quality!,5
5995,A very good course on Algorithms.,4
5996,My first algorithms course in life :D,5
5997,Very interesting course.,5
5998,Very useful,5
5999,An excellent starting point to get into a popular method of building viable business models. Good value!,4
6000,Good learning model,5
6001,"This one of the best course, I am really appreciate offering such great course.",5
6002,"So much of the content was limited without paying for the course, that calling it a MOOC is a real stretch. Because of these limitations, most of my work was done on my own, and by purchasing the related book. Since my local Community College used to run this course, but now points to this onine course instead, it's a huge disappointment. Most folks who are going into business for themselves need good information but have little cash. The one star is for the handouts (I believe pulled from other websites but pointed to by this course) - these have been useful.",1
6003,its was the best,5
6004,"It was nice, considering the messages and the amount of time. However, participation and feedback by others was really limited.",3
6005,"A short program on Business Model Canvas, good explaining and examples!",5
6006,amazing course,5
6007,great presentation,4
6008,Quick and to the point.,5
6009,Thanks : ),5
6010,Great approach and Canevas,4
6011,"Excellent course, the steps are clearly described and to work on your own canvas along the course gives an experience you could not get from the book alone. It helps if you can fill in a canvas with a real life case. Maybe you already have certain parts of the canvas filled in, this is just great because taking a holistic look at the whole helps to see where you can improve even an existing business.",5
6012,"descriptions was not enough for me, the BMC concepts could be more elaborated by giving examples and explaining different types of businesses.",3
6013,"It was really boring, just reading the text in the presentation.It can be made in 4 classes not 8.",2
6014,"Some times the videos aren´t in a logical sync with the upcoming activity, or the content from the video is somewhat vague and then not clearly explained in the class.",4
6015,Nice course which focuses on the course title.I liked the animated videos a lot!!,5
6016,Informative but not challenging enough.,2
6017,"I have given you a 2* star rating as on finishing my course promptly all the information I submitted has suddenly been locked! I haven't been able to answer a classmate's request to review his work & worse, I haven't been able to print off my own work for reference & this is a REAL project so I need to be able to do this. We were not given notice that this would happen.#disappointed",2
6018,good explaination,4
6019,Pretty good lectures and helpful for entrepreneurs,5
6020,"one of the best courses you may take to develop your business ,,,",5
6021,"The best course to understand and develop a Business Model Canvas, very useful course because provide tools and keys for success in the way to make the canvas for your own business.",5
6022,"Other than a few technical glicthes with the videos in both firefox and chrome browsers, this is a very good course. I learned to use a great visual tool for developing my business model. I would have liked to have joined in the discussions and tasks but, I think coursera is charging too much for this course.",4
6023,Still waiting for my assignment grades for weeks 1-3 despite having had many people mark these.,3
6024,"A fast and thorough way to learn how to use the business model canvas. And not just how to fill the blocks, but also how to use it in order to get data which we would not have thought of, data which might well pave our way to success !Thanks a lot",5
6025,"short, effective and precise, contain all necessary for a initial learner about Business Model Canvas. In my case, I am an intermediate learner, so it was not enough.",3
6026,If you are new in the learning of business model generation is a choice to start with. But if you already have some experiencie this course is very very basic.,3
6027,Mix of the professional animated videos + more practical lectures was excellent planning. Highly recommended post-ideation to put some structure around your idea.,5
6028,It's very good the way to describe the diferent segments to build your own business model and to give s better structure to your business idea. I'm giving 4 stars because the only way to complete the course or to interact with it is by paying the full certificate. But besides this fact it is very complete.,4
6029,"Excellent course. It gives you the essentials of the Canvas model, being very practical and useful",5
6030,great. Learnt many things. Even though only from 3 videos. I wish i could pay the other course parts...As i'm only a school student i can't afford this. Hope you will open free courses to our future generation soon. Thanks a lot.,5
6031,thanks youi love ot,5
6032,"This course introduces a relatively innovative technology, very easy to implement in many contexts (business, education, leisure...). Sometimes the lessons could be clearer, but the instructors give almost instant feedback to any question they are posed. The tasks are well balanced between regular assignments and honors assignments.",5
6033,Very useful.,5
6034,"This was the first found by me AR course (I was seaking others but they were theoritical) that teaches you how do the things by your own hands. I am writing this review a half year after completing it, being invited to become a mentor, comlpeting the course for mentors and starting to help online to the instructors. It is a pleasure to see how the things happens, especially if you are not an ICT specialist. If you overcome the stress from the first meeting with the code in the second week, you would be able to complete the course. But you should devote enought time to do the practical tasks. I am not an ICT specialist. In the real life I am an architect. Honestly to say, in beginning I was doing for some hours the things that were sceduled for 10 minutes. Shame or not, my first meeting with the code took me 4 hours, then 3, 2, one, and in the last weeks I was able to complete the tasks for the recommended time. The instructors upload examples and the students their work in a gallery, done especially for this course http://www.mymultimediaworld.com/projects_gallery/ . I am writing this review to say thank you to the instructors for revealing the process of creating AR in real. I would be happy if more people start to use this technology. This course will help you to do your initial steps to this.",5
6035,"This is just an amazing course on a most talked-about technology of these days, and the teachers make it so easy to understand the concepts. And at the end you HAVE BUILT something real!",5
6036,Very nice course with good materials and videos to understand the basic of Augmented Reality applications using the Araf.,5
6037,I love the entire course. Thank you🙇,5
6038,Very qualitative entry -level course in AR ! This Course pushed me to look at AR from certain aspects and look at more additional information in internet concerning extending my own mobile applications with AR functionality. Looking at recommended AR browser I also came to Ionic-Cordova cross-platform framework. Thank you very much for your efforts! Merci beaucoup,5
6039,Excellent course! The instructors are very terse and accurately teach the necessary elements to learn how to build and design an AR application. Well done.,5
6040,The course is pretty good for a beginner.But it emphasis too much on using third party authoring tools and proper coding is not implemented.The required code is auto-generated and we as learners are only asked to make few changes on the already existing code.,3
6041,"A good introductory course to AR. In some parts of the course, the lectures go over the code for an extended period of time jumping across different lines of code and it is quite hard to keep track of this. Thankfully, the transcript helps. However, it would be better to explain the code in templates or another way which makes it easier to learn. Overall, this course is definitely recommended to understand the basics of AR.",4
6042,Very Interesting Introduction to Augmented Reality,5
6043,The course is awesome and i like the way the instructors used to teach.,5
6044,"This was an excellent introduction to various types of AR application and how to build them. The balance between using end-user tools and programming was great for me: I was able to build working AR apps easily using the end-user tools, but enough exposure to the code to satisfy my inner- geek. I now have an understanding of what resources would be needed to de",5
6045,This course was a wonderful intro to mixed and augmented reality. Thank you all so much.,5
6046,Great opportunity to get started with augmented reality!,5
6047,good overview of ARAF,3
6048,Very knowledgable,5
6049,Enlightening! The Big History framework/perspective provides both an anchor and a compass for our journey through life - it's basic scientific literacy.,5
6050,good teachers，enlightened course gives me a way to go back and forward the big history about the whole uneverse,5
6051,"A great way to get an overview of one's place in this world by understanding the whole history of the universe before and after humans. The multitude of sciences touched upon during the course made me research on the topics discussed more thoroughly. The teachers are good, the intro music is a wee bit too intense",5
6052,It was very intuitive course with lots of example and explanation.,4
6053,Its an excelent Course. I really learned a lot from the universe.,5
6054,"Well the course is reasonably well organized the material is in great detail exceeding what I would've thought the overview concept of big history would be. Other big history courses I've taken do not go into specific date and time detail, period by period But function more in terms of how preceding events may be causative for future events (more like a butterfly effect analysis over long periods of time).If you are looking for more detailed specific history than this course is useful. If you are looking for more of the big history overview concept this may not be the best course for you.",3
6055,An amazing and very insightful course. This is the one origin story I will tell from now on.,5
6056,Excellent and very well done.,5
6057,Interesting concepts here and loved seeing all the connections. At times it was a bit too cutesy in its presentations.,4
6058,"A really well structured course filled with rich knowledge and important details. On completion of this course, the meaning of the word 'History' won't be the same again.",4
6059,"Enjoying all of it. Actually in process of going through it a second time. So much information is made available every week, that I am finding and learning new things the second time through. The variety of instructors and information sources is appreciated. Thank you for putting such a extensive course together and making it available for all.",5
6060,Wonderful course! It really should be taught in every school.,5
6061,A fascintating approach to historical inquiry. I learnt a lot and enjoyed every minute!,5
6062,"Very nice course, only minor issue is that the assignments were a tad easy",4
6063,"Good course to show that the sum total of what the Earth is today and what she is capable of is truly the sum of everything that has had an effect on the Earth since the Big Bang. Had the environment been off slightly in heat, H2O, O2, etc., the right elements had not been present, there had been not liquid water, no lightning, etc., there may not have formed life on the planet and Earth might be more like Mars.",4
6064,Exceptional course! I learned so much in such a little span of time. :) Would recommend it to everyone.,5
6065,"I'm impress and very amazed, with this course. I'm just starting, but I have my first insights and connections to the things I've written and research before, to help people, and our enviroment as well, through science, and now, BIG HISTORY <3 love it...",5
6066,Covers a lot of fields of knowledge. Beautifully illustrated and well explained.,4
6067,"Great class, please repeat it",5
6068,I would recommend this course for everyone.,5
6069,"This is a fantastic and comprehensive course. If I had to nit-pick, it would be questioning the particular coverage placed upon China in the sub-topic of ""How did Modernity evolve after the Industrial Revolution?"" and the seemingly critical view taken towards its modernisation.One point in particular was ""We've achieved a war over nature. Where we've done it, there's a cost to ourselves, as the intensifying flooding in Shanghai often illustrates. Early in October 2013, Shanghai was hit by two typhoons which came together and saturated Shanghai with the heaviest rainfall ever recorded."" I'm not a Chinese citizen, but it sounded to me like China received her due comeuppance, which I felt was a little uncalled for.While China's trade opening may be significant in world trade, I'm not sure if the particular in-depth coverage on China in relevance to the question, is a stretch.",5
6070,This course certainly connected all the knowledge I had about the Universe and where we are heading towards and why.,5
6071,"The discovery of David Christians approach, first by reading his ""Maps of Time"" and listening to some of his presentations on-line, then by attending this course was an eye-opener to me. I now try to explain the importance of the subject to as many people as I can. Not only adults or university students, but mid-level students as well deserve to be exposed to the view of Big History, It changes one's perceptions of the past and enhances one's apprehensions of the future.",5
6072,Very good for everyone who want to know about Big Questions.,5
6073,"Totally enjoyable. The videos are professional, varied and so informative. Comparing the quiz to some others , I found they were better formulated and less ambiguous.Personally I feel I learned an amazing amount in a short time span and bother the content and pace were stimulating! so bravo!This is the type of general knowledge everyone should have but probably 90 % only have a rough, inaccurate or no awareness whatsoever. This could be run even at the school level, it could stimulate future scientists.",5
6074,Such an amazing experience for me.I have always loved history and appreciated the sciences. This is the first I get exposed to the concpt of both being part of a bigger thing.Big History has connected the dots between the different academic fields. Totally recommend it to all humans.,5
6075,An excellent course indeed! Strongly recommended for 'everyone'!,4
6076,Excellent course. It is worth your time to to learn about our scientific origin story.,5
6077,big history is a good course for everybody who interest history,5
6078,"Why is this course dangerous?I took this course because first I liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe. Maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics. BUT as it turned out they don't have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means. They always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system. I think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isn't a closed system.In the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught. But if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you. One glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months. They are cherry picking. They just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma. In this respect they are so dangerous. That is the same principle how cults work.Maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one. But also here you have to be careful. When they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50! In my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way. For sure it is not helpful! But again, the truth doesn't fit in their world view.Furthermore they ""teach"" that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the ""universe balancing entropy"". This isn't just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.In summary: this is not a history course, but the ""teachings"" of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.So please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.",1
6079,Great introduction to the big history concept. Awesome production. Content of the last two weeks is significantly weaker than the rest though,5
6080,I have really enjoyed all of the lectures just for my own personal knowledge! ! Well done!,5
6081,"With a grand title and grand introduction, I found the course very superficial and gained little additional insight form ""Big History"".",2
6082,very good..thank you,5
6083,Absolutely impressive! Learning a lot,5
6084,So many new awesome things to learn from this course. I enjoy checking out the provided resources as well.,5

6090,"The high quality of videos and content makes this course an outstanding, fantastic and entertainment MOOC course for everyone who wish to learn the big history that is hidding in the Universe. Thanks coursera and macquare University for let us access to this beatiful show of altruism and openness, both of you deserve not only a big five star but a great standing applasue. Congratulations great course.All my best Coursera community,Carlos Arturo Pimentel.",5
6091,Exciting course.,5
6092,this course combines theories and ideas from many different disciplines to produce a coherent picture of the world we live in today. The picture does appear to match the real world far better than what we see when just using a single discipline. It is joined up thinking,5
6093,Amazing course that is interesting from start to finish.,5
6094,Thank You!I have been waiting for a course like this for a very long time....,5
6095,The best Coursera course I've taken so far! A daring and entertaining stab at a theory of everything :)Thanks!,5
6096,Great course! I learned a lot and enjoyed it very much. Great to get all the extra reading material on the various subjects.,5
6097,"Awesome project, awe-inspiring teachers.",5
6098,"The lectures are really well made, with nice animations underlining the material. I also enjoy the diversity of topics covered by different teachers.",5
6099,"Excellent course in integrating all the 'ologies' that give insight into how it all came together from the Big Bang to the development of life to a vision of the future landscape of human existence.Excellent presenters, the right level of subject matter content and an exceptional level of production quality.A great job done by the entire staff and much appreciated.",5
6100,"Just started this course, but so far love the graphics and the enthusiasm of the teachers.",4
6101,An excellent introduction to this fascinating new approach to history (and everything else).,5
6102,I've enjoyed this course. Thanks a lot.,5
6103,"Very insightful, entertainment and comprehensive. I strongly encourage it to anyone interested in having a holistic understanding of our Universe and its history.",5
6104,A course that changes the way of seeing the history,5
6105,"Liked the way course is organized, posing questions at the beginning of each lecture is a great idea.",5
6106,An excellent course with highly dynamic and interesting teaching staff. A mind blowing introduction to critical thinking and a eye opener as to different ways to view our world and knowledge in general.,5
6107,"Ambitious coverage of the human understanding of our reality to date. Gaps in knowledge are left for future finding, while the presentation of what we do know with some certainty is highlighted. The 4th lesson video of week 1 is a masterpiece.",4
6108,"An EXCELLENT multi-disciplinary course that provides a though-provoking overview of world history. The videos are interesting, the additional resources fascinating.",5
6109,Very interesting and mind expanding.,4
6110,"This is definitely my favorite course on Coursera and anywhere else in internet! So glad I accidentally ran into it! Under a name that doesn't tell much about the content there is a real jewel - a multidisciplinary course that is truly able to connect many of the dots and make perfect sense of all these endless math and science, history and many other classes we all had to sit throughout our school years. I loved every minute of this course, all the experts zooming into subjects, all of additional materials (especially Crushcourse videos). Big History course is awesome for those always asking ""but why?"" questions. A very big thank you to The Big History course team for finding time and passion for making it available to everyone in the world!",5
6111,"Great course, fantastic presenters, smooth sailing and at the same time though inspiring.",5
6112,This course has taught me so much and is very detailed and in depth. I recommend this to anyone,5
6113,This is a very simple course about complexity. I do a lot of rabbit holeing so found the lectures a good way to organize further reading and research on various topics. would recommend this class highly,5
6114,"I find the week 6 of this course completely irrelevant. Also, I'm attending courses on Coursera to learn and quizzes are IMO an essential part of that process, but definitely not essays. For me personally, essays are just waste of time and there's nothing beneficial about them.Another thing that bugs me is how questionably and often misleadingly are thermodynamical laws interpreted by the professors in this course.",1
6115,"I loved every minute of this course. I only watched the video's because of lack of time, but really was sorry when reaching the end. Iit is packed full with (new) insights, very entertaining with excellent quality images, comments from the various lecturers that will make you think in a more balanced way about the world we live in.I did not know about Big History and signed up out of curiosity. However, I believe it should be mandatory for everybody to get this kind of connection of various disciplines to understand more of what got us here.Strongly recommended!",5
6116,Great ideas. Great course.,4
6117,A great eye opener and excellently presented. The rise of complexity as a driving force of development and evolution was a great learning point.,5
6118,Absolutely amazing. Every detail of this course has been done with the perfect combination of precision and beauty.,5
6119,"Looks and sounds like a great course. Can't wait until the 28th March 2016 to start week 2. A bit annoyed with myself rushing quiz 1. I think one has to really pick all the meat off the bones of the information to get 100% (unless one is a Cosmologist - anyone got Stephen Hawking's phone number?)Just finished week 2 and I am already giving this course five stars. A really-really-really top course, a sit up all night job. Still haven't found Stephen Hawking's phone number yet. He probably realises I'm looking for it, clever bloke and honorary Python that he is, and gone ex-directory. Can't say I blame him, I'd do the same if I found out I was looking for my number!",5
6120,"Riveting lectures. Weaves knowledge from astronomy, physics, chemistry, economics, anthropology, genetics, geology, etc. into history. Enthusiastic presenters, unique assembly of knowledge, comprehensive coverage, entertaining and informative. Highly recommended.",5
6121,It is very good but it doesn't explain every thing,4
6122,"Loved this course and I am recommending it to everybody I meet. A truly refreshing perspective on life, the universe and everything!",5
6123,"Excellent lecturers and high-quality material to study, although the course is heavily centered on human History as opposed to Big History - i.e. early Universe and its development over a time span of billions of years.",3
6124,"This is a good course. I liked the idea of the 9 thresholds of increasing complexity, with the energy required, the Goldilocks conditions, and emergence. I want to think about this a bit more, and see how I can apply it to other, smaller, thresholds.I like the idea of restoring the idea of a story to history. It's time to think about whether we should be moving into the driver's seat, and whether we have any idea of where we want to go.What would it take to make this a great course? The Discussion Forums don't seem to sparkle the way they do with some other courses I have done. I have completed other Coursera offerings, such as Origins (University of Copenhagen Natural History Museum), Our Earth (Climate, History, and Processes - University of Manchester), and Introduction to Genetics & Evolution (Duke University), and there was a lot of discussion among students. I felt that I learned a lot from the discussions, and not just the formal lectures. I also noticed the lecturers participating in the discussions. I cannot understand why this hasn't happened on this course, but it is part of my feeling that this course has a way to go yet.",4
6125,"Excellent overview of 13.8bn years, places a history framework around the story of the Universe. uses the concept of thresholds to help explain how increasing complexity has led humans to where they are today.",5
6126,"Wonderful course. The resources are very useful - I spend more time going through those, than watching the videos. The timelines and glossaries are very helpful. Everything is very well done. It's also interesting to have the variety of instructors with different backgrounds. If I'd had a course like this when I was in high school or college, I might have become a geologist. Fascinating stuff.",5
6127,"Great course! Tons of information explained in easy to understand terms. Lecturers were, by and large, enthusiastic and engaging. Plenty of extra material provided for further study.",5
6128,Fascinating coverage of ALL of history. Great presenters,5
6129,I am amazed by this eye opening course. THANK YOU!,5
6130,excellent reconnection of knowledges obtained through reductionist methodology,5
6131,"Enjoyable course and I appreciated the interdisciplinary nature. At times, I felt like I wanted to delve deeper into the content, but I understand that this MOOC, like most others, are breadth courses designed for incoming Freshmen.",4
6132,"Very interesting, unbelievable professors and very clear use of the English language, that made the course easy (even in subjects I was not familiar with) for me since it is not my native language...",5
6133,The Best and the most fundamental course for every human being. (I'm serious),5
6134,I am enjoying the course.,5
6135,Great course!,5
6136,"Very nice! I like the variation and the montages of the video lectures very much. The variety really kept me enticed and paying attention throughout everything. This course would also be a perfect self-paced course. Interesting subject matter as well! Very important for everyone, to get a sense of where we are and where our lives fit into the bigger picture.",5
6137,"This is a wonderful and absolutely mind-boggling course. I am so glad I got this opportunity to take this course and be introduced to this topic. The range of topics covered are diverse and they make you think of how it all began, your past, present and future. I will like to thank all the professors and contributors who made this course.",5
6138,I just love this topic. It is really fun and teaches you a lot.,5
6139,I wish this will be a nice and interesting course.,5
6140,The course content had met its objectives. I loved the way interdisciplinary sciences were explained precisely from Astronomy to paleontology to economics,4
6141,"This course is blowing my mind (in a good way). It has been a long time since I've felt the wonder of the world (and universe) of which I am a part. In addition, this course is expanding the language with which I can talk about and understand my environments (new and old). The information is well-organised and concise and the resources are a good blend of academic, creative, informative and fun and the lecturers are knowledgable and passionate. I hope this field floods the world's places of education.",5
6142,"Impressive, amazing and the really explanation of everything!!",5
6143,Interesting and insightful for those who are looking to find their position in the history of the whole universe.,5
6144,thank you very much for your efforts on this course,5
6145,It is useful.,5
6146,"Exellent course, with",5
6147,Truly insightful and enjoyable big picture course. Much effort must have gone into its preparation. Makes you want to to learn more.,5
6148,"Fantastic course - great content, very informative, and engaging presentations",5
6149,A definite course to take. You learn so much and enjoy doing it. Can't recommend enough.,5
6150,I love how experts from a variety of different fields of studies participated in creating this course!,5
6151,"Good, engaging and thought-provoking course.",4
6152,"Excellent course! Profound interdisciplinary expedition from the beginnings of the Universe (since ""the Big Bang"" ) through the creation of galaxies, to our Sun, planets, beginnings of life on Earth, evolution of that life, major changes to earth resulting from activities of our unique species (humans), toward pondering what the near and distant future might hold. Using the concept of ""Thresholds"", the course aims to make sense of and connect major themes and trends as it traces the fingerprints of the unfolding of the cosmos - of which we as humans are an interconnected part.",5
6153,Initial reaction: Superb……Lectures are succinct and understandable. Support material seems well selected and informative. Forums are lively and peopled by very interested students……Towards the end of the course however I began to wonder about the efficacy of some of the claims and I had a growing doubt about much of the material used…...,4
6154,Brilliant summation of knowledge of our universe from the beginning. Lucid and engaging.,5
6155,A super well structured course with high quality lectures and enveloped in a deeply interesting narrative.,5
6156,I recommend this course as I enjoyed every bit of it!,5
6157,"It was such a fascinating journey through time, knowledge, within myself and into the universe! I loved every moment of it and now I am touched because it's over. Nevertheless, I know Big History is in me, just as I am part of It (as small as, and apparently, insignificant one may seem) and I am full of gratitude towards the entire warm-hearted, generous, intelligent, very highly skilled and talented Big History team. Thank you very much indeed!",5
6158,"The course is very nicely done and well organized. The fundamental organization around sources of learning and the progression of lessons are well done and strongly support knowledge building. Some of the speakers have verbal patterns or flows of speaking that can be a bit distracting, but they are all interesting and informative. I like that you can also download transcripts. I am a very visual learner whose mind tends to wander off when faced with a talking head. Having the transcript to follow as I listen allowed me to highlight and make notes while listening, ensuring greater attention to the content. Ultimately, I made the decision to not finish the course. Not because the course was not well done but because it doesn't align with my own interests in systems thinking and complexity. It is a good course and well worth engaging in, even if you discover, as I did, that it doesn't quite match one's learning needs. I do recommend it if you are interested in cosmology and theories related to the origins of the universe.",4
6159,A sweeping journey throughout the story of everything - an overwhelming subject championed in a tractable way with both a mind-boggling and sobering message.,5
6160,"A well-taught, mind-expanding, perspective-altering course. Everything is presented in an interesting and understandable way, even complex topics such as cosmology and chemistry. I can't rate the Big History course highly enough - it has inspired me so much and I can't wait to keep learning.",5
6161,"A very interesting and broad introduction to a new and exciting form of interdisciplinary form of history, that gives a wide perspective on a big range of sciences from biology and cosmology, to social and historical sciences. Would easily recommend for everyone.",5
6162,Thanks for creating this course in very well organized format and sharing such an incredible overview of the history!,5
6163,This Astronomy course is good but for people that are more interesting in the big bang theory and how the universe came into existence today.,4
6164,Absolutely love this course. I would say this is the mother of all courses. It provides a very elegant framework to information and knowledge one may acquire. I am loving it. Apparently this course helped Bill Gates become a Polymath.,5
6165,Finally! A creation myth based on evidence and multiple scientific disciplines for all humans is here! The time for stories based on speculation and superstition for the chosen group is finally over.,5
6166,This course covers a lot of complex material in a concise and approachable manner. It is possible to understand the content (and most importantly learn about the subject) without having a scientific background.,5
6167,Absolutely awesome! Thank you.,5
6168,"the last assignment is too time consuming, I didn't completed it though I finished all the other assignments.",4
6169,Excellent course of history of our origin.,5
6170,"The history of the universe, mainkind and the future in 6 weeks. A very short introduction but a good idea",3
6171,"A very pleasant narrative from our story from the Big Band to present days connecting many areas of knwoledeg from astrophysics to genetics, passing through geology, archeology, anthropology, ancient and modern history, economy amomg others.",5
6172,"Very nice overview, but it seemed to be too much information for the limited time. There should be a separate six week course for each threshold.",4
6173,"A great survey of the last 13.8 billion years of our universe touching on the sciences--physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology all viewed through the lens of history. A thought-provoking overview that whets the appetite for more.",5
6174,An interesting perspective. I hadn't thought of combining all history into one outlook before. Thanks.,5
6175,This was an amazing adventure. I was really pleased to be part of Big History. I'd recommend everyone who's interested in history to check this course out.,5
6176,A fundamental course everyone should take!,5
6177,This is the history course I should have been taught at school!,5
6178,"Excellent course, really well presented. Informative and enjoyable.",5
6179,i love this course. it seems good!,5
6180,everyone should take this course!!!,5
6181,"Incredible course in every way: Highly competent lecturers, excellent video quality in both content and production, great pacing and delivery of information and dozens of links to engaging resource material.One of the best MOOCs I have ever participated in: fun, informative and intriguing!",5
6182,Incredible course.,5
6183,"They speak clearly, allowing differences of opinions without insulting beliefs, break each segment into the components parts and giving current information on each so that a student has sufficient information to decide - and enjoy the 'claim tests'.I have taken coursera courses in each of the segments as well as having higher ed in some that are nice to get up-to-date - and all in one place - to begin to see what Alex Humboldt called the web of the world.",5
6184,"Various professors which are inspiring and knowledgable.Good format, short videos and links for digging deeper.But it´s a five star course because I enjoy being flabbergasted with my origin myth.",5
6185,"A logical expansion of the way history should be taught, Big History starts with the Big Bang and moves on from there. The historical information is not new but the perspective it encourages provides a way to tie history closer to science and the major events that have changed the universe, our world and human life. To often in history we get caught up in the details. Big History makes sure that the big picture, and how we fit into it, is always visible.",4
6186,What a wonderful course! This is a unique perspective that links human history with science and the very beginnings of our universe.,5
6187,"At this moment, this course has been really good.",5
6188,Thank you for this great opportunity!,5
6189,Probably the best of Coursera's courses,5
6190,This course was really good for me. I was able to learn the basic theory and working of how services and content providers work in Android. This course helped me alot.,5
6191,Tricky concepts explained in a good and practicle way... But you will have to spend much time by reading and analyzing examples and solving optional exercises... And reviewing past Moocs to extract all date from this mooc.,4
6192,Great and helpful Course!,5
6193,"This was a really good course, you'll learn, by example, theory and practice, why, how and when to use these Android App Components. Reading the entire code of each assignment is recommended, otherwise you may not fully understand why your code works, also, you may learn additional things by doing it.",5
6194,This Course is So Great and I want to thank Prof. Schmidt 'cause every explanation is clear!,5
6195,Need little change or update. But very good explanation!,4
6196,"This course took me three months of several hours of work a week to complete. While I definitely learned a lot during that process, it would have been really helpful to have more active instructor engagement and feedback (although I realize that this may not be possible when an official course session is not in progress, which is when the bulk of my work for this course took place).I also think many of the problem statements could have been more clearly defined. For example, I spent a lot of time on the ""Bubble detection"" problem constructing graphs that allowed for multiple edges between two nodes, when it turned out that in order to pass I did not need to implement this.That being said, I've learned a lot from the courses in this specialization, and thanks for the work put into it!",3
6197,"Really Challenging course, will make the mind to work.Enjoyed taking the course, was much harder than expected and loved it anyway.Worth the time ,effort and resources.The course was much less guided compared to other the course but instructor mentioned it that it was on purpose for developing self learning and facing real life sitituations.",5
6198,challenging,4
6199,"The problems are interesting, the course is great. However, the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well-defined, which makes it really difficult to solve (especially the dataset problem). The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple, but is not applicable to a large set of problems, only to the particular dataset that is given (and the characteristics of this dataset is not given; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset, which makes the problem more difficult).The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly.However, I really appreciate the whole courses, and I think it has been a great experience to go through the courses! Thank you very much!",3
6200,very difficult course if you are new to R. Otherwise an okay course,3
6201,"Lots of good data. Really a walk through of coding without too much theory. Would prefer a little more theory. Would have helped in completing the course and capstone. Ended up having to take Eric Lander Intro to Bio course on edx to really understand what I had done. In particular, a better explanation of what is going on at a basic with methylation marks and how the Epigenome Map was constructed.",4
6202,The quizzes were engaging but i think it requires some knowledge in use R for data science. Though i learned a lot. Thanks again.,3
6203,It is a good start for people who study epigenomics!,5
6204,"The course is hard and needs previous knowledge of R. The time for for doing the ""quizes"" are not long. On the other hand, the questions resemble real world bioinformatics problems. The real inconvenience with this course is that the Forum does not work. Because not all that is questioned in the ""quizes"" are thought in the classes. So a help from the Forum is a real need for this course to work smoothly.",4
6205,The course is tough and needs lots of practice and time to handle the stuff explained in this course. In my opinion the stuff should be split into 2 courses (partA and partB) with detailed explanation of every covered topic.,4
6206,A nice course to introduce Bioconductor to students,4
6207,I think it is a good class overall but the pace is fast and the resources that can help you is lacking. This will be good for someone who already kind of understands bioconductor.,4
6208,the class gave me nothing. nobody wan's to waste tons of hours to learn nothing. so I personally think this course is on of the worst classes among the Coursera.,1
6209,Course is not good at all. The instructor assumes that you have a good genomic background.,1
6210,I struggled so hard! No way near the same level as the other courses.Came from Computer science background and felt that I missed so many terms and concepts that were required for this course,1
6211,There is not support in the forum,3
6212,"Very frustrating and disappointing experience. The lectures were hard to follow on many levels:1) The enunciation was unclear and subtitles were often of-the-point, plus they covered-up the code lines that were being discussed.2) The lecturer often failed to explain logical constructs that were being used, despite the fact that the course should have been understandable with no R cran/Bioconductor experience.3) The method arguments were either not explained, or very vaguely mentioned, which means applying them to new situations was unnecessarily complicated.4) No feedback at all was offered from course organisers/reps to anyone, even after complains in discussion forum about quiz questions.5) No feedback for solving the questions/correct answers even after the deadline.6) Quiz questions required methods and logical constructs that were not explained/used/mentioned in the lectures. One quiz lacked background information of what data needed to be used (the info was available in the previous version of the course). Some quiz questions were biologically inaccurate i.e. confusing genes/transcripts/exons.",1
6213,"Discussions in this course are voiceless and dead and the instructor never appears in discussions. I couldn't understand anything from video lectures: cannot understand enunciation not enough detailed, lack of examples related to the assignments. So the only source was repository http://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/ with html files. And a lot of searching through bioconductor forums.I liked the relevance of quiz questions to real life genomic questions, but all quiz questions were outstandingly difficult, because of both lack of examples in lectures and errors in some packages inside bioconductor.Overall I expected much more from this course and I cannot recommend it to anyone.",2
6214,"Excellent introduction to Bioconductor. Thanks to the team. However, absence of inputs from TA or Instructor was felt in the discussion.",5
6215,I learned a lot from this class and the instructor is good.,5
6216,"Four stars because the content is good. Not five stars because the english is not so good and for a non-english expert it can be difficult to understand, and the subtitle contains quite often errors.",4
6217,升级到第二学期！fight！,5
6218,complier error all the time!!!!!!,1
6219,A good introductory course. Easy and you can begin to program after taking the course.,5
6220,Easy to understand.,5
6221,One of the best!,5
6222,Minor mistakes in examples and exercises.,5
6223,The teacher explains concepts very well. Really worth the time to go over the lectures several times.The programming assignments however lack instructions and the online judgement system has some strange requests which are not illustrated in the instruction. You have to guess what the assignment is about each time.Overall very good lectures but poor assignments.,3
6224,The teacher is devoting and the courses are very helpful for first-learners.,5
6225,This course is really useful for me. It helped me clarify many programming concepts and strengthen my programming skills. Thank you very much!,5
6226,Great Lessons! Great teacher!,5
6227,The problem sets are like real life problems and the lecture focuses on what are the most confusing parts. It is a valuable course for someone who has just a little computer programming background to start one's journey with C language.,4
6228,So easy~But the teacher is well！,3
6229,"Excellent content. The instructors are very thorough in their explainations. The only fault I see is that there isn't many students doing the course, and such it is hard to get help, especially if your schedule is tight and you can only do online courses on Saturday and Sunday. Looking forward to taking the Advance course though.",4
6230,Excellent course. The high level modeling language that is presented is very powerful and relatively simple to use. Maybe a couple of more lecture specifically dedicated to the modeling languange itself would allow easier kick-in to the course.,5
6231,C,5
6232,"""Basic Modeling for Discrete Optimiation"" is an excellent course for anyone interested in optimization models, improving their problem-solving skills and have a nice challenge.The explanations and examples are fantastic and all these complemented with the utilization of MiniZinc, which make the course so much natural in comparison to other optimization tools.Highly Recommended 5/5.",5
6233,Good Assignments.,4
6234,"Amazing course, amazing material and amazing lessons. For everyone interested in Discrete Optimization MiniZinc is a must know technology and this course does an amazing introduction with lots of different applications.",5
6235,Cool,5
6236,"A very interesting course ! Serious and much developed work. Nice special interactive lessons (though speaking english is necessary to understand them), important to get deeper information about some themes. This course is very useful, to be able to evaluate animals welfare through their behaviour, and then to improve it with suitable ways. I just wish there would be more concrete examples of enrichment for wild animals in captivity... I hope this course will be used by more and more people in the world. Our animal friends need it ! Thank you ! Cours très intéressant, et développé. Les leçons interactives apportent des infos complémentaires bienvenues sur quelques thèmes (mais il faut pouvoir lire l'anglais...). Cours très utile pour apprendre à évaluer le bien-être d'un animal grâce à son comportement, et pour pouvoir l'améliorer par des moyens appropriés...",4
6237,"High quality material offer a good insight about animal welfare problems and challenges. This course really opened my mind to a variety of topics, giving me new points of view.",5

6239,"great MOOC that I have learned, appreciate all of the teachers and workers job.",5
6240,"Perfect! I enjoyed learning new information about animal welfare though the parts of slaughter and use of animals in testing is not very pleasant, but it's reality. Thank you very much for this course!",5
6241,"Excellent course content, well presented enjoyed it thoroughly !!",5
6242,It was a wonderful course. It gave me great insights into animal behaviour and welfare issues that really enhanced my knowledge and experience as an animal lover. The course is well structured and comprehensive.,5
6243,"An excellent opportunity to broaden my knowledge on the topic. Has been extremely helpful in my activities as an animal rights activist in Costa Rica. Well structured, clear lessons, witty and appealing.",5
6244,Very insightful and important topic! I am thrilled that this is available. This should be a requirement for everyone who works in any setting with ani,5
6245,"Wonderful class, gives a lot of information and points of views on how to improve animal welfare. Lessons were relevant, direct and easy to understand, a real asset to anyone in the animal welfare community or people working in animal agriculture. Great and sensitive instructors.",5
6246,Very usefull course as an introduction to animal welfare!,5
6247,"I found this course very interessting. It gives you a lot of information about animal welfare in different areas such as pets, farm animals, zoo animals and laboratory animals. It was easy to follow as the lessons were very clear and full of scientific data and real examples.",5
6248,"Amazing, super interactive, all the basic information is there to generate interest in the participants. I quite enjoyed it.",5
6249,Excellent course! Very informative and usefull! Highly recommend it.,5
6250,Very informative and useful course for developing the fundamental knowledge regarding Animal Welfare and Behavior.,5
6251,i have many new idea about how we should manage the enclosure and breeding management,4
6252,I found this very interesting and informative.,5
6253,Essential knowledge to improve moral values.,5
6254,"I missed information about behaviour in wild and domestic animals and also, some of the papers that you recomend are not for free, so some of us can't acces to that information.",3
6255,"I am a dog trainer in the United States, and I highly valued the information I learned regarding animal welfare of all species. I am very passionate about animals and how they are treated, so this course was fine tuned to exactly what I care about. I enjoyed everything I learned here. Highly recommend!",5
6256,well informed and covered a large range,5
6257,Thank you for this course.,5
6258,"Animal welfare issues in this course are not presented as cruelty, as they truly are, but it is very informative and science-based, which is important.",5
6259,Beautifully instructed in this amazing lyrics interesting and highly informative course. Thoroughly and enthusiastically enjoyed it!,5
6260,Not very useful. Somehow general.,2
6261,being veterinarian student it was a power pack course to learn about the behavioral activities in various animals. I am thankful for all doctors who helped me in understanding this !!,5
6262,I really enjoyed the course. I would have liked to have more information about the regulations in the European Union and less stats for the UK.,5
6263,"I really enjoyed the perspective and things I learned. I thought I could have scored higher on the quizzes because I was saying the same thing as them, but just in a different way. I would recommend this course.",4
6264,"It was a very interesting course, I learned many things about animal behaviour...Thank you!!",5
6265,I wish that it would have focused more on cats/dogs/horses-- but it was really well done!,5
6266,"Very nice course, thank you :-)",5
6267,"Great opportunity to learn and even if used as a ""refresher"" for things you may have previously learnt, it is well worth the time to doFantastic course,",5
6268,Brilliant introduction to animal welfare.,5
6269,Thought provoking introduction to the complexities of animal welfare. Thoroughly enjoyed the course and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in welfare issues.,5
6270,I work at a veterinary clinic and have found this course to be very informative and useful for my current career path. The knowledge I have gained from this will surely assist me in providing the best care for the animals under my supervision.,5
6271,"That's my first course on Coursera, i couldn't even imagine how interesting it would be!",5
6272,"I have learned a lot about the research performed related to animal welfare and I have new perspectives of what it is needed to be improved, not based on my beliefs, feelings or point of view, but from the animals' perspective and needs to have a better welfare. I am so exited to be able to learn more about this topic and someday work somewhere I can apply it.",5
6273,Very nicely prepared and impressively informative,5
6274,"Very interesting and easy going apart of the informal and scientific based lectures. I enjoy it a lot!!100% recommended not only for thoose who have a pet dog, but for all of us to understand better our four legged friends who live and a pat of human soceity!!! :))))Well Done!!",4
6275,"I can't explain how much I enjoyed this course. It's content and resources were so easily accessible and easy to understand. I am just new into the Animal industry so this was a perfect way into it. The passion the lecturers had was so plain to see and I loved that. I makes me want more.I am so happy I did this. So happy, I want to enrol on another MOOC :)THANKS EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY <3",5

6279,Excelent course with many examples of animal behaviors !,5
6280,Good but can be long due to accompany material,3
6281,Very good understandable !,4
6282,Thank you very much for creating and maintaining this educational material.,5
6283,Great course!,5
6284,"This course is great for anyone who is doing animal healthcare or any related field. It gives good principles of what is proper welfare and also the issues of negative or debative welfare. They also talk about how welfare is applied in certain countries to give realistic perspectives and thought of how the world conducts it's business in the world of animal livestock farming, or wildlife captivity. It's a real eye opener and I'd recommend people who are just generally animal lovers, professional or not, to take this course. I absolutely enjoyed it and learned new things from it!",4
6285,"Very good course, I love ! I was afraid of dogs, but since I studied this course, my fear for dogs disappeared.Think you so much .",5
6286,so much to learn. great course,5
6287,great course,5
6288,"This was an exceptional course! I really loved it, the way it was set up, and taught.I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the welfare of an animal.",5
6289,"Interesting, diverse and deals with compex subjects. Highly enjoyable!",5
6290,"Interesting topics, and some good information presented on a variety of issues for many animals and situations. However, presented info is often vague and generalized, some sections discuss very little scientific data to back up claims made, and course is generally not very rigorous or challenging.",2
6291,It's fun and understandable,4
6292,"Very helpful and covered a wide range of topics, this course has definitely helped me widen my knowledge on animal behaviour and welfare and will assist me with my future career.",5
6293,Great course! :),5
6294,"What an informative course! Your Professors (all women, and which I find very impressive and inspiring) are so knowledgeable, so broad-based, as well as detail-oriented in their quest to bring animal rights to the forefront of worldwide consciousness. I would love to visit University of Edinburgh someday, I'm an alumnus of University of Montana (B.A.) and Gonzaga University (M.A., and Ph.D. candidacy). Thanks so very much for offering this most important course for free and to make it available for certification so that it can be added to any resume.",5
6295,Thoroughly enjoyable and informative course,5
6296,"Great course, covers all the basics on the groups of animals owned worldwide, very open minded and sensitive without bias. Thank you!",5
6297,Excellent content very well set out,5
6298,Thank you.,5
6299,"Great course!! If you are interested in animal welfare particularly animal welfare in animals produced for food, this is a very good course with lots of resources.",4
6300,I totally love this course! And the teachers are great!,5
6301,"Opened my eyes a lot regarding the welfare of all kinds of animals and their situations.Really sad course content, but needed to show the severity of how bad it can be for an animal, and the ways being used to stop and protect them.",5
6302,"Very informative, well put together, and just so nice to be able to take a course on this subject. Really appreciate the free courses by Edinburgh University's Veterinary School. I've done Equine Nutrition and Do You Have What it Takes to be a Vet? I really enjoyed both of them and learned a lot.",5
6303,Great!!!,5
6304,"This was a really cool, fun course, and I learned a LOT, but I was hoping that they would talk more about the animals in captivity, and major issues relating to them. Other than that, it was an interesting topic to learn about!",4
6305,i found this course very interesting past it just need to know if i can obtian the certificatewithout taking test again as passed them already,5
6306,Great course.,5
6307,"Very interesting course, well organized. Thank you",5
6308,*No Stars*Another boring animal class that I would not recommend. The teachers do seem nice and well educated however it is still too boring and slow for me.,1

6310,I have learnt much on the course! thanks.,5
6311,really enjoying this course so far,5
6312,Excelent course!!! It makes you a better person because more conscious. It transform your way of understanding animal welfare. Thank you very much,5
6313,Excellent Course! Thoroughly enjoyed it.,5
6314,Well made course with very good talking teachers. The course felt alive.,5
6315,"It's great, i recommend it.",4
6316,"Great course! In the past, I've worked on farms and in the veterinary area, and I still learned a lot from this course. Thank you all!",5
6317,"This was an excellent course. It was well put together, and presented in a way that kept me engaged and interested. I learned a lot and feel that I am much more well-informed on the subject of animal welfare now.",5
6318,"Interesting, thank you for making this course available. After taking it I transitioned from being pescetarian to vegan and I wish that more controversial animal rights concerns were more focused on.",4
6319,"Very informative course. If you think you're interested in animal behavior and welfare, you will be interested in this course.",5
6320,"Opened my eyes to a lot of what is going on especially in the animal food industry, and animal behaviours and animal welfare that we don't consider when a visitor to a zoo or game farm. If more of us became aware, and understood the issues as well for both the industry and the animals, new policy via populace advocacy might help even further. It is taking too long for this, considering we live amongst animals for companions, and eat animals for survival. WEll most of us do.",5
6321,Really interesting. Plenty of new knowledge for me.The additional material was really useful.,5
6322,"Wonderful course about animal welfare issues today and how to improve our their well-being. I have always been interested in animals and I thought I knew a lot about them. This course provided a lot of objective information about the experiences of all different species. There's still a lot to learn, but I will be recommending this course to anyone interested in understanding a little more than the basics about the welfare of animals.",5
6323,"Loved this course. It has really sparked my interest in learning more and building my small store of knowledge further. Good content, interesting lecturers, varied strands within overall subject. This is my second course run by Edinburgh University and I will certainly be looking for more.",5
6324,Loved this course wonderful instructors very informative.,5
6325,Very good course with a lot of complementary material and good classes.,5
6326,"Great instructors and good information. I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in aspects of animal welfare across the board, but especially for someone who is considering getting their first pet. The concepts are explained well, and easy to understand.",4
6327,very well taught and covered so many topics. thank you for teaching this course. I look forward to its next session.,5
6328,"i found this a great overview of animal welfare, i enjoyed the videos, and found the questions relevant to the content.",5
6329,"This is a very nice course. Thank you so very much for it.It covers so many aspects of Animal Welfare. At the introduction, it is explained on how to have a useful discussion on such a delicate subject.With so much information and facts given, one can develop their very own opinion on this Animal Welfare.I find it very important to cover Animal Welfare for anyone, who works with any kind of animals.Alongside this course I studied Dognition and Basic Horse Management. Soon I will be starting Dairy Farm Management and Horse Nutrition.",5
6330,It would be perfect if within the learning material is included in PDF files. The content is wonderful,4
6331,"I loved this course. I wish there were more courses about behavior, welfare and animals in general.If I ever visit Scotland I'll visit you guys! Thank you for this opportunity.Regards,Carla Romano.",5
6332,I loved this course because it was simple and enjoyable. I could easily finish is alongside my schooling and extra things. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a career with animals :),5
6333,Loved this course,5
6334,"The course was very concise and accessible. I enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of people involved in the course, each one of them presenting their field of expertise. Sometimes a quiz-based course can be a bit dull, but the hangouts and comments let you question certain topics or practices and add depth to the discussion. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a brief, general introduction to animal behaviour and welfare (do keep in mind that it is not an animal ethics course, but the information provided can help you question or strengthen ethical positions).",5
6335,"Absolutely brilliant course. The pace, the information, the explanations, all very well done. I'll admit, some of the videos and images were difficult to watch, I would suggest a warning right before it is shown as to mentally prepare. However, I may be overly sensitive! Thank you for this course!",5
6336,Informative and rational. Content stayed right in line with the objectives. Clearly outlined and discussed via lectures and informative readings.,5
6337,"Too many animal mistreatment clips were shown, also some gross misstatements of biological-scientific truths and widely held facts. Humans cannot change the genome of any living creature, DOGS are WOLVES and always will be. We have domesticated and bred for certain personality traits and characteristics. Done with your course.",1
6338,A very interesting course and a much needed one in the times that we leave...I found it very difficult not to be affected by my ethical views and emotions but I managed to complete the course and learn a lot of new things. Thank you for making it available!,5
6339,I learned so much about the welfare philosophies that are practiced across the globe! I look forward to future courses with this wonderful institution.,5
6340,"I like the course, since I was born into a family that loved animals. I believe that this course will make a better caregiver to my animals.Thank you",5
6341,Very informative.,5
6342,"Excellent. As a veterinary student, I found this course to be very enlightening about the subject matter. I'm now able to implement some of what was learned about animal behaviour and welfare in my daily professional activities as well as in the classroom.",5
6343,Great.!!! But if the content would be more. I find it unfair for a topic of such importance to be given so less attention. People will also respect it if the content would be more than it is right now...!!,4
6344,Course was very informative. It also had many amazing resources!,4
6345,"Informative, though-provoking and enjoyable. Excellent materials.",5
6346,good to have a knowledge about the animal welfare and their needs,4
6347,"That´s very nice course, my focus is Poultry and I did find very useful the information that i learned in the course, Thank you Coursera and Staff of the University of Edinburgh",5
6348,I really enjoyed this course and I learned quite a lot from the lectures and extra material resources that were provided. The professors and speakers obviously love animals.,5
6349,"Thouroughly interesting and well presented. accessible to all levels of knowledge. But it has just wheted my appetite, I want to learn more!",5
6350,A good way to get your feet wet on the topic of animal behaviour and welfare!,4
6351,Nice overview into animal behaviour and welfare with enough examples to make it easy to understand.,4
6352,As a Pet Care manager at a boarding facility I encourage my staff to participate in a continuing education progam for rewards. I stongly encouraged them to sign up for this course. I am taking this a second time as it was extemely interesting the first time. Anyone interested in animals in general should check this out!,5
6353,This course tells us more about animal welfare and the problems animal face.,5
6354,I will recommand my friends for this kind of course.,5
6355,"Fantastic course, well presented. Easy to take at your own pace, videos allow you to pause and rewind learning at any point.Excellent content, with knowledgeable presenters. Highly recommend",5
6356,"Five weeks in and this is one of the best courses going, This is a course every potential animal carer should take before considering 'cute' and 'expensive' just because they come with a certificate of pedigree with names one can't pronounce of prize winning ancestry. Drive past the puppy and kitten factories and go down to ones local RSPCA centre or council pound instead, you will never regret it. Rescue animals are the best because they will never forget your kindness for giving them a nice comfortable home.",5
6357,"My major is not about agriculture, but I love this field very much. That is the reason why I spent my time with this course on Coursera. This on-demand course is very convenient for anyone who want to know more about animal agriculture. I strongly like and recommend this course.",5
6358,Fantastic! I am loving every minute of it! I would highly recommend this course to anyone interrested!,5
6359,Very interesting course which makes you thinking and analysing while reading and listening and communicatin and looking at things seeming obvious from another angle. Helps to open the world and your own mind in different way.,5
6360,Very interesting look at modern Brazil and a good practice for an intermediate level language learner.,5
6361,Great!,5
6362,"Good course to improve your Portuguese skills: there are both audio, video and texts. You learn some stuff about Brazil too but there is too much talking about identity, which is very abstract. I wish there were more podcasts as for Week 5, which was the most interesting one. Thank you to the teachers for this interesting course :)",4
6363,"This is my second course in Coursera. While I found the first one extremely basic and too expensive for the content of the course, I think Pluralidades em Português Brasileiro is a well build course, full of interesting information about Brazilian culture and with interesting contents about language. In my opinion it's a good tool to help working on your Portuguese while learning about the culture of the country.",5
6364,Great quality course.,5
6365,Great. It help to improve advanced portuguese.,5
6366,I really learned things from this coarse which I would not learn it easily from life .,4
6367,I would like to thank the Course team for the very impressive work they did to afford us with such a structured and valuable content.It was a very interesting course that will help me to improve and work better on my carrer developpement.Thank you!,5
6368,everyone looking for a job in any country should do this course.,5
6369,Its a great course where we learn many tips to make our career successful! Thank you!,5
6370,"Very interesting course, although lacks course notes. The final test (week 5) had a few questions which weren't covered in the lesson.",3
6371,"great overview, and very enjoyable/interesting.",5
6372,"Really good course, taken whilst I was in year 9 of high",5
6373,"A great overview of the profession and the field, suitable for those considering becoming vet surgeons and vet nurses. Great job of working around the limitations of online learning for such a hands-on subject, too!",5
6374,I have learnt a lot about medicine and how the world has a famous sheep and there is a royal museum,5
6375,This is a great taster course in order to get a realistic insight into what a course in Veterinary Medicine is actually like. For me personally this taster course has further reaffirmed my dream of studying Veterinary Medicine at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies which I have applied for this year.,5
6376,"I really enjoyed this MOOC, it gives a good idea of what to expect at school but also as a client. I didn't appreciate being evaluated about the nearby buildings of the school or the name of Dick's sister. Really not the type of thing that would make me chose one vet over the other.",5
6377,The richest basic course I've ever taken.,5
6378,"I loved this course and was pleased that my faulty science was not a huge stumbling block.The history aspect of the course provided tremendous context and I cannot agree with students who might believe it to be irrelevant. In order to progress to the future, one must always have an eye on the past. Having said that, long ago I studied the Enlightenment as an integral part of a BA in English Literature!Realistically, I am too old and lacking in science qualifications to become a vet - but were I to be 35 years younger - I'd strongly consider working hard towards gaining Science A Levels and aim for veterinary school.Nevertheless, I feel that this course has given me some insight as to how to get the best out of future consultations with my very lovely local veterinary practice.In addition, I was pleased to see Dr Andrew Gardiner presenting the final part of the course.Dr Gardiner's book, The A-Z of Cat Health and First Aid is a wonderful resource, particularly in respect of abscesses, a problem which certain other books only cover in connection with dental ailments rather than the very common problem of abscesses on a cat's back, shoulders and face as a result of fighting!",5
6379,A great overview full of pretty important aspects and details. I Really appreciated having the opportunity of taking this course!,5
6380,very good and easy to understand even though i am 11 years old i passed everything as the lecturers were extremely clear very good!,5
6381,Excellent insight in case you want to become a veterinarian!,4
6382,"It was a very informative course with a wide variety of videos and additional resources. The only downside, however, was that in some review quizzes (particularly the one for week 5) there were a few questions on subjects that weren't covered in either the videos or the additional resources provided.",4
6383,thank you,5
6384,i really enjoyed this course,5
6385,This was a wonderful course and it built a really strong foundations for my veterinary aspirations! It also set up a basis for some generalised learning which is indipensible and will prove useful over the next few years!,5
6386,"The course is uneven at best, with some modules providing insights and knowledge and others not so much. The presentation in some of the modules is perhaps an example of how not to do it, reading fro a script in a monotonous voice. Some of the material, like the lengthy historical review of Edinburgh's vet school, might be good advertising and interesting, but does not fall under the scope of 'what it takes to be a vet'. Good idea, but, with a few exceptions, less than average execution.",2
6387,"The knowledge share is really good, thought provoking as well as precise and straight to the point. Although, it is very basic, it refreshes your minds on veterinary practice and new things are learnt.",4
6388,"The only thing stopping me from rating 5 stars is that there are questions on the quizzes that are not covered in the lectures or supplementary material. So be sure to have your Google window open and ready during the quiz.Otherwise, I love the course and am happy to give it a 4 star rating for the quality of the lectures.",4
6389,I'm so happy with this course because in the bottom of my heart I really want to became a veterinarian.. Thank you very much ^^,5
6390,"This course was very interesting and gave insight to the kind of material first year veterinary students would be learning plus history of the profession (mostly the school). The professors present actual anatomical (dissected) organs and histology slides. I also thought the husbandry section well done. The clinical portion is a little weak but understandably, given the medium and safety issues. I still enjoyed it. The history portion is a bit too in depth, I feel, and though interesting, spends a great deal of time on the history of the school and founder itself. They are very enthusiastic though, which is a plus. The course does a lovely job of presenting some of the various studies that go into this rigorous education/career, such as client interaction, anatomy, histology, animal husbandry, and examination skills. It is so much more than just a love for animals. I will certainly look into some of the other animal science-related MOOCs offered by Edinburgh. I had no difficulty in completing this course in one week although I do have a medical background.",5
6391,So great but I found the last module about history of veterinary medicine overly long and boring,4
6392,The tests are kind of hard but they are qualified and educational.,5
6393,good cource but its medical content about how to treat disease is low and needed to be moreand clinical cases is low alsobut another topics is very good,3
6394,"Hello, good day you have:I think it is an excellent course because it gives us a very broad about what is the career of Veterinary Medicine scene. Thank you very much for making it accessible to the person who wants to take it.If I may make a suggestion I would like pusierna subtitles in Spanish for people who are not fluent in English.Thank you very much to the University of Edinburgh, the Dick Vet and veterinarians who developed topics. Much success in any endeavor they undertake. THANK YOU VERY MUCHSincerely:Javier Martín Montelongo Montoya from Mexico",5
6395,this course is very good especially for any one love to be avet he can know here in this course what he must do and need to be avetthanks for this useful course,5
6396,"I just completed my week 1 and it just very interesting, i love it!",5
6397,Great Course!,5
6398,"I strongly recommend this course. It is a very good introduction to breast cancer and the management, with exceptional presentations. Congratulations for it!!!",5
6399,Brilliant. well organized and tons of information. I totaly recommend it,5
6400,Very good course!,5
6401,l really enjoyed this course. l have taken many courses through Coursera and l have loved them all. l found that Dr. Chagpar is an interesting and fun teacher. l found her easy to follow and understand. l highly recommend this course if you are looking to learn more about breast cancer.,5
6402,"Wonderful, wonderful course made even more wonderful by Dr. Chagpar's enthusiastic and engaging manner of speaking. Kudos to our mentor, Denise, as well",5
6403,Very informative and interesting!,5
6404,"This is an excellent course serving as an introduction to breast cancer and the many treatment options.Dr. Chagpar has done a magnificent job of presenting the material and her passion for the subject is evident.The world is lucky to have such a dedicated professional present this important health information to students around the world and free of charge from one of the greatest universities.I would have liked some additional information on diet and alternative therapies as well as proton therapies, however, as Dr. Chagpar explained, there is little data on these subjects and clinical trials are still going on.If you are interested in breast cancer, then this is an excellent place to start and highly recommended!",5
6405,very informative!,5
6406,"Introduction to Breast cancer is an excellent course ! Anees Chegpar is an awesome and entertaining teacher. She speaks clearly and efficiently.The course is not too difficult to understand, it is well designed for patients, friends or family of patients and people simply willing to know more about breast cancer.",5
6407,"Great Coursera, great teacher!Mabye this is the reason why Yale University is known as Yale University!I wil learn this course one more time someday.",5
6408,"Great course with a great instructor. The course was aimed at general pubic interested in Breast Cancer, so the it is structured to be very easily followed. While I was looking for a more challenging course, the course does a great job as an introductory course.",5
6409,An amazing introductory course ! and Dr. Chagpar has a unique teaching style,5
6410,"I REALLY appreciated this course! I was diagnosed with breast cancer in April and have been working to learn as much as I can in the interim. I actually learned that I need radiation from this course (none of my providers had mentioned it), so I am really grateful to have participated in this. Really good information, engaging professor, and well organized content.",5
6411,Excellent! A very enriching course and is easy to understand. The professor is outstanding.,5
6412,It is a really great course and I would like to recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about breast cancer. Thanks Yale for the opportunity given us to learn with you.,5
6413,I learnt a lot form this intro course. I love the way the professor draw picture.,5
6414,"Great course; very informative, highly educational, fascinating... There were just two things I didn't like about the professor, though I liked HER a lot; she was very welcoming, hospitable, and amicable; she treated her students well, and was enthusiastic about teaching us. That is a trait I have seen for the first time on Coursera, and I have to give Dr. Chagpar high praise in these terms. The only things I did not like - which are very small in contrast to the things I did like - were that she taught a bit as though she was teaching to 6th graders, rather than seasoned adults. But that is not much of an issue. My only other complaint is that she seemed quite callous towards women suffering - even dying - from breast cancer. But I suppose breast surgeons come to distance themselves from these terrible, tragic events.",4
6415,Loved the course! Loved Dr. Chagpar's enthusiasm and expertise in this field.,5
6416,"Mrs. Anees Chagpar has been an amazing course instructor. She managed to keep my interest captivated through lists of numerous NSABP codes and rather unfriendly data, on an issue that is much debated and triggers reasonable concern and controversy and is often viewed as a terminal condition.",5
6417,perfect work.iam soooooo happy duo to connecting to this course,5
6418,"It has been very enriching, has freshened concepts, and I've learned to new visions respects. Very interesting, thanks!",5
6419,Simple and easy to understand. Excellent introductory course to cancer in general.,5
6420,Very easy to understand and also very helpful.,5
6421,I really liked this course. I think there was a lot of content covered in a short period of time and the way that it was presented kept me focused. I think the professor was able to present the information in an effective way. I would definitely recommend this course.,5
6422,Very good information. Thank y,4
6423,Great! I got a lot. Thanks.,5
6424,very good thank you,5
6425,"I am really impressed with the way Dr A.Chagpar teaches and explains , A very good teacher.Sushma Batra",5
6426,This entire course was very well done. I enjoyed learning all that I did concerning breast cancer and loved the integration of interviews to practically apply much of the knowledge learned to specific roles involved with breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.,5
6427,"Good course, great instructor.",4
6428,"I have participated in several MOOC courses and this would have to be the most informative and enjoyable. As a breast cancer survivor, a carrier of BRAC1 and community nurse I found it reassuring and invaluable in terms of content; engaging in presentation; sufficiently challenging to keep me focussed and hugely helpful in working with Breast Cancer patients. A big thank you to Dr nees and her co- presenters.",5
6429,"Very informational, especially for hospital volunteers and health care employees",5
6430,A comprehensive and thorough introduction to breast cancer. Great teacher!,5
6431,Detailed course with recent information about new treatment strategies and clinical trial data. Easy to understand for non-clinical professionals!,5
6432,It is an excellent review of breast cancer field. I enjoyed it very much. Thanks very much to everyone who prepared the course.,5
6433,This course was just what I was looking for. I am entering into the field of pathology as a pathologists' assistant and this laid it all out in the simplest of terms. Now I can approach each breast case from the gross room with a lot more confidence! Now I feel like I can delve deeper into breast pathology on my own and have a solid foundation to work off. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,5
6434,Information is well,5
6435,"I enjoy the instructor, she is so passionate about the subject. What a great course!",5
6436,"Great introductury course. Well presented, excellent up-to-date-sources, and a tad of a challenge...",5
6437,Great course! so engaging and easy to follow. very informative for all types of audience.,5
6438,"very good and informative course, really enjoyed it.",5
6439,the way of introduction is quit helpful to see speaker and lecture,4
6440,"I really like the subject of the course. The presentation was really good. However, some of the concepts were not so easy to understand. The course does not provide any reading, so I had to watch the lectures again if I forget some of the details. Eventually I've started taking detailed notes and added screenshots to my notebook. I wish I could have more exercises just for practice that would not be graded. That would provide a safe env. to learn and practice before taking final tests. Some of the answers to exercises were very helpful to learn the concepts better. So, more such practical exercises would be helpful.",4
6441,Thanks a lot to coursera ...,5
6442,"Course is mostly theoretical. So far it's difficult to say anything about its practical implications and usefulness. It's my first course on Coursera, so I can't compare. But I think sometimes it lacks a bit clarity, especially considering lecturer's English and bad quality of subtitles which sometimes do not match real lecturer's words. Anyway it was interesting and now I'm really intrigued about how I can apply this new knowledge to real everyday development tasks. Most probably I will try following courses in the specialization. Thanks a lot to authors!",3
6443,"Although superficial, it is a very good MOOC for introducing LTS testing.",5
6444,Useful introduction.,5
6445,very helpful,5
6446,Very interesting and a good fine-tuning experience to my brain relating to systems! Awesome!,5
6447,"I've learn more thing's in this course..., thank you Coursera :) :) :)",5
6448,i get perfect information about antimicrobial resistance ...thank you,5
6449,"Great course, It gave me an overview of antibiotic resistance problems.",5
6450,"I enjoyed this course. It was quite informative and good in introducing some concepts for me like the QA/QC/QM topic that I was not very familiar with. A good follow-up would be to present a course on how to build laboratory capacity in this area for countries wanting to get better at AST. I would also suggest that some of the presentations be shortened particularly those which will be presented in much more detail later to avoid the doubling up of information eg like the section on methods were covered almost twice for some material. Also, I would like to suggest use of practical examples when trying to explain these concepts. I thought you presented them well but for better understanding, use practical case study examples showing how you handle the situation in the lab. For example, provide us with when these methods are applied so they are not just random.Thank you for this course and I look forward to your follow-up course.",4
6451,Very good complete introduction to a very important subject!!,5
6452,"Overall, the course contents is useful. If course slides can be provided, that'll be extra helpful.",4
6453,Thank you so much for the interesting course. My thesis in master was on Antibacterials and (and more subjects) I am much interested in Microbiology. I am going to continue my PhD in Microbiology and this course was a kind of review for me with some new details. Especially ResFinder was really interesting to me. Thank you so much for the class.,3
6454,I'm very interested while taking this course as it's very related to my recent study.The material and syllabus are very easy to understand.Thank you very much,5
6455,Many thanks for a very enjoyable course. Please keep up the excellent work.,5
6456,"Good course, gives a good notion of the basics. Very technical (as in it emphasizes more the technical part of antimicrobial testing) and basic (in the theoretical part). I'm an MD student, currently on my final year. The course brought up new aspects to the antibiogram that I was oblivious about, something that I think is very important for the modern-age physician.",4
6457,Muy instructivo,4
6458,It was good learning experience!!,5
6459,"It was really a nice course, and it would help me from recollecting the past experience.My sincere thanks to the Madams, who delivered their valuable speech.",5
6460,Best presentation for Antimicrobial.,5
6461,This class was very much eye-opening as I have gained knowledge and experience,4
6462,"I did like to course very much. However, the in the last video, although the lecturer tried to speak clearly, I didn't understand all things very well.",4
6463,"This course teach all things that useful and importance for preparing to everyone who want to know about antimicrobial resistance. Don't think a lot. Take this course and learning it, NOW.",5
6464,very good and useful,4
6465,good but not giving marksheet which is much needed somewhere i want to used..,5
6466,I really enjoyed learning from Dr Lina Cavaco.,5
6467,Excellent course to refresh or fresly learn about antimicrobial resistance,5
6468,The course covers all points about antimicrobial resistance in a simple and complete way.,5
6469,I loved this course. I study biology at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and it's helped me a lot to understand many things in general about antimicrobials susceptibility. Thank you all!,5
6470,"I found this course pretty useful and interesting.I am a pharmacist working as an information manager mostly on hospital medicines, and the antimicrobials play a huge part of the prescriptions.It was very good to better understand the mecanisms behind the resistances and the racional to choose the best agent agains it.",5
6471,"Content was good, but occasionally VERY hard to understand the lecturers' English. Worth taking though.",2
6472,"It was a really good course, but I think there´s a lot of repetitions in many lectures. It´d be good to avoid that aspect in order to provide more information to the people.",4
6473,The last two weeks are a bit DENSE. Especially Week 4. Bring your Brain power. But a course worth learning from for relevant skills to use in lab.,5
6474,Very good and helpful!,5
6475,Great! Waiting for the next one,5
6476,Excellent course. Thanks!,5
6477,Thank you to DTU especially to Dr. Lina Cavaco for expanding my knowledge about drug resistance and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Hoping for more lessons about drug resistance. Thank you once again,5
6478,"Very educational course, however the lectures are very lull and do not hold attention well.",4
6479,good work thank you all,5
6480,"The course is really interesting and I found it really useful. However, there are lots of repetitive lectures and I think they could be grouped and summarized or even expanded for topics avoiding the repetitions.",3
6481,This course is very interesting but in some points it get repetitive and it gets boring. I recommend to reduce some videos and not to say the same thing too many time even when it's very important,4
6482,Nice introduction course but with substantial amount of useful materials and knowledge! Excellent presentations!,5
6483,This is an excellent introductory course in the field of antimicrobial testing.,5
6484,It was really a good lectures and please I want to know about my certificate in have already purchased this course and submitted allThe documents let me know when will I get my certificate .,5
6485,So nice... I've learnt a lot.,4
6486,excellent for me and my carrier,3
6487,"Excellent course, looking forward to do other courses from the DTU in antimicrobial resistance.",5
6488,good course,4
6489,Amazing course. Thank You coursera,5
6490,"I feal so amazed by all the information, is a complete course and i would like to learn more about antimicrobial resistance. Thank you professor Lina <3",5
6491,"I loved the first three weeks for the really well presented background information. Weeks 4 and 5 did not give me any further interesting knowledge. I also missed lectures on qPCR, NGS and other molecular methods for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes, as these methods are up and coming. Overall, thank you for setting up this course",3
6492,Very important course that help to know several ways of anti microbial susceptibility testing.,4
6493,It improved my understanding of drug resistance,5
6494,Really interesting!!!!!!!!!,5
6495,A good overview on antimicrobial resistance and how it is measured in the lab.,4
6496,"This course is quite interesting for people interested on microbiological field and research because show general concepts, different techniques and tools which are used on laboratory to identify, monitor how these resistance on microorganism take an important part on public health discussion. I recommended to refresh any knowleadge that have on microbiology field.",5
6497,"I really enjoyed the course, being a complete novice i found it challenging to understand some of the technical terms but learnt alot.",4
6498,"lectures are too long, it lacks clinical correlation.the course focus only technical lab issues, when you look for antimicrobial resistance course, the last thing that you need is tech theory. Of course that some concepts are needed in order to provide fundamental basis, but the main goal is and always will be how to interpret antibiograms and infere the most probable mechanism of resistance. So there is a need for clinical correlation. If its not present, the course should be entitled ""Laboratory methods for antimicrobial resistance""",3
6499,"Really great, a little more specificity on the subjects (More time) would be even better.",4
6500,Very nice lecure.easily understandable.,5
6501,Great teacher and contents.,5
6502,Great Course!! Some lectures were repetitive. So I'd like to suggest the course advisors to cut down on those lectures. Overall it was a great learning experience!!,4
6503,vital information suitable for the workforce.,5
6504,"If you want to get in *depth with the philosophy and history of Tibetan Buddhist meditation, this is the course for you! I am so grateful to have had access to this vast sea of knowledge presented! Some of the lectures are a bit long and are not accompanied by PowerPoints, illustrations, or keyword pop-outs, but if you apply your meditative focus, you will be graced with an immense amount of information on the topic. There are also practices (with intros and conclusions) presented by three different teachers each week. You can really tell a lot of thought, effort, and love went into this program design. The inclusion of Dr. Saron was just a delight as well - I am inspired to continue in my research and my practices related to this course. Thank you to everyone involved in making this happen!",5
6505,A great course. Really helpful and plenty of good insights.,5
6506,"Loved it. Extremely theoretical, speculative, deep and heightens inner world understanding. A true unpuzzling of the inner world!",5
6507,"Excellent course, plenty of food for thoughts! I totally enjoyed it.",4
6508,"At first, I thought the course was too academical of an approach to Buddhist meditation, but as I learned more, I came to understand the profoundness of meditation beyond the ""meditation for dummies"" process that I expected.",5
6509,"unnecessary, excessive and distracting time expent on the difference between pali and sanskrit.",4
6510,"The course has some Immense contribution by many brilliant professors, monks and practitioners. A Huge workload though, I had to make new replacements three times to catch up with the assignments, lots of resources, I also kept making screenshots as it is impossible (like absolutely!!) to digest all the gems provided. Special thank you to Dr. David Germano for super organised and put together lectures, and Dr. Clifford Saron, just listening to the later speak is a great deal of meditation - so special and highly connecting. Thank you to all creators and contributors!",4
6511,Wowww! Thanks! Gracias!,5
6512,Fantastic materail with terrible structure and loads of material. Course should be at least twice as long.,5
6513,Excellent Course if you really want to visit your inside world - Manish Behl,5
6514,"It was much more complete, diverse and time-consuming than expected. The quality of the teachings was inequal in my humble opinion. I found Pr.Germano a bit stiff in his teaching and it was very hard for me to follow his classes. Other teachers were great though.",3
6515,"Excellent!!! The course changed my life, simply that!! Waiting for the others!!!",5
6516,"Sorry for my English.So many people looking forward to take this course and was very cold, robotic... full of theoretical and repetitive texts.",2
6517,"Extensive and lenghty, it's academic and practical approach makes it great for new meditators. Also the inclusion of traditional and new advocates for it complete the worldview it presents. It transformed my mind.",5
6518,Its a great course!,5
6519,"Well-structured, highly informative,",5
6520,Very intense course,4
6521,"It is excellent course. The sessions on meditation are very useful. However, for understanding theoretical part some patience",5
6522,Wow! This course really reveals the full breadth and growth of Buddhism. It creates a deep understanding of all its past and current dimensions.,5
6523,"The course is supposed to be very informative. It is in fact. But after I spend hours raising my intellectual level trying to understand what they're talking about, I still have no idea what is the purpose of the meditation.Or rather I have it, but from another source, from a person who's been practicing it for 20 years. In 10 minutes I was given a crystal clear and logical answer on what is was all about. Unfortunately this course doesn't give this answer. It will rather improve your skill of understanding highly intellectual texts and will show you some interesting stuff about the brain.",3
6524,This course was nothing like true Tibetan Buddhism which is my religion ! please consider canceling it immediatly or having me or a real lama as the teacher,1
6525,Good overview of buddhist meditation,3
6526,This is a course that sounds like a bad audiobook. The prof. reading a the lecture and giving lot of information without any soul or teaching energy to engage. I prefer then read a book about this topic than being here at this course get bored listening at the same tone a reading of a lecture.,1
6527,Audio is terrible - can't continue,1
6528,Not well presented at all. Great disappointment.,1
6529,"Great course, their are parts that are dry and very academic but taking the time to listen and take will payoff and be very rewarding. I particularly found the neuroscience research most interesting and engaging. The labs are a great way to end tie together everything that is learned in each section from: academic to science to history/application.",5
6530,Good intro on meditation.,5
6531,"First time as a long (more than 30 years) empirical yoga and meditation practitioner that take an academic approach outside the masters himself. Wonderful experience. Very well done, excellent material and the best professors. Thanks",5
6532,"Really horrible in instruction, experience and application ability of lecturers, poorly put together and assembled. It was astonishing to experience such self-promoting hacks rather than knowledgeable practitioners of the art of meditation. It is very important to clarify the content of a somewhat titled misnomer. The course was an academic study in mediation bring is rather esoteric, questionable, and personal opinion concepts and comments; in effect a mesh-mash.",1
6533,Audio was difficult to hear at times,2
6534,Uninspiring and boring.,2
6535,The amount of effort that was put into this course was impressive. The amount of information was impressive. There were wonderful and engaging speakers to amplify the learning process.,5
6536,I am very disappointed about the content. It is not a course. Pr David Germano is just reading text. No design no learning experience. I would learn much better with just reading a book. It is a shame I was very interested in the subject.,1
6537,"It´s a very complete course with a lot of detail and valuable information. For me it has two parts, one very technical and the other that is more into the spiritual meditation and techniques. I think it was worth the time and effort. Thanks a lot!",5
6538,"This course feels a lot like it's being taught by a non-teaching professor. The lectures are very long, not chunked for easy viewing (to the point where I couldn't download to my phone for offline/off-wifi use). There are very long locally-hosted readings (so they're hard to print and you can't add them to an offline reader app), and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography (rather than actual reading assignments), because there are no links and some refer to ""Selections"" without giving page numbers or, in at least one case, a multi-volume book. The information is comprehensive and very valuable, but the delivery is very lacking as a MOOC.",2
6539,"The course is very useless, there is no meat, only water - there is no substance - only talking around the topic. I am appalled that such research exists, and ashamed for the coursera",1
6540,"This course was one of the most useful of my undergraduate and graduate career. I have been a long time Buddhist practitioner, primarily in the Zen tradition and found it difficult to integrate, both in my own practice and through understanding popular literature. This course provided much of the intellectual background that I have wanted for a long time. I am particularly interested in the discussion of Buddhist Meditation as a religious vs. secular practice, and the cultural content of the various practices one encounters.David Germano's lectures are incredibly information dense. I learned to download the transcript and outline and highlight them as well as listen to the audio. Now I wouldn't cut out a thing.I particularly appreciate the many guest lectures, interviews and guided meditation sessions.All of my questions are not yet answered but I have some clearer understanding and ideas for moving forward.",5
6541,"Excellent course! History, neuroscience, practice, discussion... This course is a life changer. Thanks to all professors and guest.",5
6542,"Before I began this course, I had only a very general knowledge of Buddhist meditation. After going through a number of lessons, I realized I really knew less than I thought. I had only been attracted to the Buddhist world encountered in readings and travels. For many years, it was something that I wanted to know more about. So I appreciate having access to this course.Classification and organization of detailed and complex material is well organized. Great work amassing and presenting knowledge of contemplative practices.I feel there was some repetition or redundancy, but in my case that was not necessarily a bad thing, other than to add to the mass of information being delivered. The repetition helped to stabilize my memory and helped to establish a baseline of concepts from which to build my understanding.I became mired in detail, but absorbed as much as I could in lieu of being able to recall consciously specific pieces of information. I don't want to judge the presenters by suggesting that they tried to put too much information into too little of a space. I found my efforts to absorb the info meditative in nature, thus I welcomed the challenge.The videos of presenters reading texts of detailed and dense info was difficult to follow at times, but I discovered that it helps, in some cases, to download the script of the talks and follow along with the video as I read the script.The focus on history and historical debates and conflicts between shamatha and vipassana practices, etc., within Buddhism were helpful but not as key as the meditation practices. I suppose it is difficult to separate them since they are so entwined.I have learned a lot more than I ever expected when I began this course.I value discussions and sharing among students, but the course is so dense and time consuming that I had no time left to participate in sharing with others. Not to devalue the info itself, which is fantastic.",4
6543,The course appears unfinished and very disorganized. The lectures are monotonous and boring.,1
6544,Learned a lot and already integrated daily meditation into my life.,3
6545,"The early lectures were profoundly dense, monotone and cluttered with non-contextual detail while being (strangely given the subject) seemingly empty of a real desire to share, or convey, understanding. I am confess that, as much as I was looking forward to guest lecturers, I couldn't make it past the first three.",2
6546,"The labs are superb. The title is misleading - it is as much about the neuroscience as Buddhism, and the lectures are dry. However, because the labs are so good, I give it five stars.",5
6547,Not for the basic student looking for information. Very detailed,1
6548,"I have to admit that the professors know the topic and are conducting amazing research, but the course was dry and terribly designed. The videos are too long, without quizzes or activities to break the long dry monologues. They also talk like robots and one gets lost really fast. I have taken many courses in coursera with long and short videos, with boring and engaging teachers but this is by far the worse. They are trying to show off so much information and in such a high level language (to most), that it makes it incredibly boring. I should add that I have studied Buddhism, and there are so many better ways to provide people an opportunity to come into contact with this beautiful topic.",3
6549,"Excellent guided meditations and a very well organized and well presented overview of the Lesser Vehicle of Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. The layout of the course was particularly good; with a theme each week and a set of lectures exploring the practice in question from a cultural and spiritual viewpoint, a set touching on the scientific aspect of the practice, a set outlining the history of the practice, and a series of guided meditations.",4
6550,to much talk,2
6551,"Too much theoretical. Probably this is not the course I was looking for when I joined it. Nevertheless, I will try to get some concepts from it, particularly for what concerns the practice of meditation and mindfulness.",1
6552,Great course combining the practice of Tibetan mediation with modern scientific dis,5
6553,"Amazing insight into various contexts surrounding Meditation, coverage of different cultures interpretation of meditative(contemplative) approaches, roadmap of practice to pursue a lifetime. Also on the side, covers academic dimensions of real life applications and impacts. Quite honored to come across such an enriched course and accruing such immense knowledge in such a short time. Hoping to revisit again in future to comeback to basics and not just veer away into real life applications and lose the way.",5
6554,Very interesting course.,5
6555,Very interesting history and practice of meditation,5
6556,"This is an excellent, in depth course packed with information and guidance on many levels including Buddhist philosphy and history, Neurology, Mindfulness and Meditation practices, and an introduction to both calm and insight meditation. Labs provide an additional resource with guided meditations and explanations. There are also inerviews with knowledgable academics involved in related fields.Instructors range from Buddhist Monks to knowlegable Professors from University of Virginia and other instutions. Most lectures are interesting and done in away that communicates well on video. Dr Clifford Saron took difficult scientific data and made it understanable. One extremely gifted and knowlegable professor, however, often rapidly read his lectures, full of academic jargon. Even so, it is well worth the effor and rewarding information wise to sit through his videos which you can stop and start to make notes.I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject.",5
6557,"All right, this is not a very ""easy to follow"" course. But it's such a great opportunity to deeply study the subject with great specialists and meditation practitioners : how lucky we are ! By going slowly, step by step, being aware that I do not understand everything at once, I'm all right, convinced I'm learning a lot, from both an academic and personal point of view.",4
6558,"Watch one or 2 lectures before you join the course, if you felt okay then go ahead, otherwise don't waste your time and money, something wrong in the course structure...",1
6559,"The course gives multi-dimensional (traditional, scientific, research) perspective about Buddhist philosophy, primarily on meditation. A highly self-contained course, content completeness is remarkable. A systematic description of various type meditations is high appreciated.",5
6560,great course. loved the talks by virtually all the instructors and might even repeat the course again. thanks so much.,5
6561,"I think the teacher had to little expression , it was like he was reading loud, and I felt I might have red the text myself. I lacked some enthusiasm",1
6562,Great content - learned a lot. Would be easier to follow if David's lectures would be presented more accessible - not read in a monotone voice.,4
6563,"Was a LOT more more than what I expected, and more effort than any other Coursera that I have done before. It is also the best course I have done on Coursera by far! Well done to the team who put it together and I am looking forwards to part 2, 3 and 4.",5
6564,it was a great experience that i get this course.regards for every one.,5
6565,"The faculty of this course represent a wonderful assembly of knowledge and experience. But the course was not well organized, and the emphasis on fine teaching that I have found in most Coursera courses was not present.",3
6566,I didn't like the main lecturer of the course. I believe his is smart and everything but for me as non-native english speaker I found the way he speaks is extremely hard for comprehension.,3
6567,empty of value,3
6568,"Very good course, profound and complete. I strongly reccomend it.",5
6569,Interesting,3
6570,Well presented -- I love the idea of combining science with history and meditation.,5
6571,Simply not as engrossing as I had hoped it would be.,2
6572,"I have been reading about buddhism for a little while, and this course has shown me a bit of the great complexity, a most human comparison between differen schools where each one claims to be ""better"" (no doubt buddhists are also humans), the great importance of cultural differences between east and west, etc.I have also been fascinated by the introduction to neuroscience, the great complexity of our brain, the drawings of a blind man, our multiple channels to access and interpret the worl around us.And I am also grateful for the introduction to meditation practices.This is a great Coursera course, thanks to all those persons and institutions that have made it available for so many of us,,,",5
6573,Clear and well presented,5
6574,"Really like what I have taken away from the course. I felt the presentation of some of the information a bit overwhelming, pure lecture without any visuals.As a suggestion, I think it would have been interesting to hear the presenters talk about their own personal journey/story with respect to meditation, even if it is purely academic without any practical implication for them personally.Many, many thanks!!",4
6575,Terrible...can't believe how a quality the course is. Embarrassing.,1
6576,"This was a great course. The professor, assistant prof, guest lecturers and supplemental material were all excellent and very informative. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in either learning about Buddhism, or meditation. With regards to meditation, you will learn about various types of meditation and contemplative practices, as well as several scientifically verified studies results which have definitively proven various benefits associated with them.I am waiting for the next course in the series ""The Greater Vehicle"" to come out, so that I can take that one, as well.",5
6577,too hard to follow,1
6578,"The richness of materials presented in this ambitious course are impressive. There are lectures and interviews with professors and Buddhists from well beyond the expected disciplines of religion, sociology, and neuroscience--including education, law, and business. With guided mediation ""labs"" from three practitioners there's a style for everyone. Some of the lectures are dense and challenging to follow but well worth sticking with it. Looking forward to section two.",5
6579,Overall - Good course - covers both theoretical & practical.,4
6580,"Very nice course, it varies a lot with the content so many different angles are mentioned.",4
6581,"Interesting topic, . but the videos are too long and sometimes lack of dynamism . I recommend the comparison with Science.",4
6582,Very good. There is room for improvement. Congratulations.,4
6583,"Great theme for a course, perfect idea, but I had some issues with execution of it. So, these are the issues:",3
6584,An excellent introduction to Buddism,5
6585,"The course was a very comprehensive introduction to Buddhist Meditation:- there were lectures about the different Buddhist meditation traditions- practical trainings on Buddhist meditation- neurological and psychological view on the effects of meditation on the human bodyand many more topics related to meditation.I found the course was actually overloaded with content: most videos were too long and there were too many videos. Some videos were more like reading a text: the lecturer was most likely reading his own script from a Teleprompter instead of really talking to the audience. The videos were not bad, but I see some room for improvement for most videos of most lecturers. My favourite videos were from Anam Thubten, he was most genuine and convincing to me.All in all it was still an excellent introduction into the topic for me: a big thank you to all people involved, you did a great job!!",4
6586,I really enjoyed this course and got a lot of personal growth out of it. The variety of the presenters and the scope of the information was very engaging and enlightening. Kudos to all involved with this course material!,5
6587,"Super experience. The teacher I found less convincing is Prof. Germano who is very learned and knowledgeable, but conveys his lessons with an extremely boring, monotonous voice, adding lots of details making it difficult for students to grasp the essential ideas. Other than this, I loved the rhythm and the many wonderful teachers who shared their knowledge with us.",4
6588,"I enjoyed the course, the structure and the material. I really enjoyed the interviews with some of the speakers. Occasionally certain lectures were a little dry for video.",4
6589,Very informative but not very focused or streamline. The lectures on brain plasticity and such I found largely irrelevant to the subject matter. Maybe an attempt to make the lectures a little less 'wordy'. I know this is Buddhism which is notoriously filled with concepts and long winded explanations but I think a lot of viewers could lose interest. I enjoy the course but I already have a great deal of familiarity with Buddhism. I was a Vajrayana practitioner for three years. Maybe a course focused more on Shakyamuni and the basics of Buddhist teaching along with a few courses familiarizing listeners to terms might be useful as a preliminary to the following courses.,3
6590,Just the kind of in depth analytics I've always wanted relating to Buddhism. Excellent semantic discussions as well as descriptions of nuances of technique.,5
6591,too many videos and texts.,2
6592,extremely boring teachers,1
6593,"This is a very well done course on the basics of Tibetan Buddhist meditation, as well as a fantastic intro into the research being done to understand how meditation effects us physically, mentally, and emotionally. This is a course I will be coming back to again and again to refresh my own understanding, and I am truly looking forward to further modules when they are released. Thank you to all the staff for bringing us this contemplative gem.",5
6594,Some lectures are presented in very flat boring to follow manner. Though neuroscience part is presented brilliantly and makes it totally worth.,3
6595,I'm giving this course four stars because of the ground breaking nature of what is being attempted here. I appreciate its place in the historical assimilation of Buddhism into Western culture. I applaud the diverse and interesting bunch of people brought together to present the course. This despite the mediocre presentation skills of the principal course academics.,4
6596,"Very insightful, great interviews, and resulted in lots of thoughtful contemplation! Thank you",5
6597,A well-balanced staff and selection of lecturers. A proper provision of the tools necessary to understand and practice the material. A very enjoyable and diverse course!,5
6598,Very Informative!,5
6599,"As someone who was taught a small amount of meditation from china in the context of another training, I found this course very informative, I have a much better understanding of the history and of the practice as it has evolved to today as well as the connection to the Mindfulness Movement. The work by so many researchers trying to prove the benefits was very interesting. The guided meditation and teachings by the monks made this a wonderful course.",5
6600,presentation has to be better,2
6601,"This course contains a balanced content of meditation practice and scientific studies on the topic. I enjoyed the content and delivery of the course. The course helped me understand the structure and organization of the Buddhist teachings. Looking forward to the next courses.N.B: First few sessions might seem a bit slow and boring. My suggestion is to be patient and not drop out, great material will come afterwards.",5
6602,"This course provided a very firm foundation for understanding the philosophy and traditions of Buddhism. The application towards understanding the growing interest in Buddhist practices of meditation is very well covered in this course. Throughout the course, we are introduced to the science supporting the value of meditation for helping us to maintain wellness, or to overcome various issues of suffering in human life. I highly recommend this course and the University of Virginia to anyone interested in developing knowledge of Buddhist meditation practices.",5
6603,This course is pretty amazing and contains an enormous amount of information. Some of it is presented in a very boring and hard to follow way. It took patience but is worth the time.,4
6604,"The positive.What a wealth of material! This is a very worthy attempt to integrate the history, philosophical underpinnings and modern transformations of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.Clifford Saron’s Week 2 lectures on neuroscience and neuroplasticity were fascinating and intriguing introductions to the topic - very engaging.The negative.Too academic for an introductory course. David Germano’s lectures are full of information but he doesn’t help the learner to make sense of it. His ‘academic speak’ obfuscates meaning rather than making it accessible. More diagrammatic slides at the start would give learners a framework of the overarching concepts.Because of the many perspectives presented each week, this course needs A LOT of time. I personally would have leaned better if the course were broken into smaller weekly segments.",3
6605,"The course integrates information on practical benefits of meditation, results from scientific studies of neural responses, and historical and philosophical perspectives. Also, I found the guided meditations very helpful and interviews quite interesting.",5
6606,"Good content. MIght want to change up the presentations for variety - add visual aids, etc.",4
6607,"(I posted this review in a blog [https://guhyasamajacenter.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/review-of-the-free-coursera-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-and-the-modern-world-lesser-vehicle-course-given-by-uva/]. Much of the courseware was outstanding. Many of the videos were so poorly done (boring) that I couldn't watch them. (I do not watch people read prepared text in a video. Ever.)----------- From the blog ----------------------------------I recently took the FREE Coursera course, ""Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World"". (https://www.coursera.org/learn/buddhist-meditation) From the course catalog: "" Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explores the immense variety of meditation practices past and present. We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course."" (Note: In the class overview, it is noted that the term ""Lesser Vehicle"" is ""perjorative"" but they use it anyway. ??"")There are many FREE reasons to take this FREE ""Lesser Vehicle"" course (the first of four):#1 - An awesome, wonderful hour-long interview with Sharon Salzberg, one of the founders of the Insight Meditation Society. What an awesome lady. I was not aware that she is also a Dzogchen student. (Did I mention it was FREE?) Worth signing up for the course just to skip to Week 6 to watch this interview.#2 - Guided Meditations by Dr. Anne Klein and Anam Thubten. Very, very, very nice. FREE, it's ALL FREE.#3 - The Science of Mindfulness against the Background of the Scientific Study of Meditation videos with Dr. Clifford Saron, neuroscientist. His videos start in Week 1 and continue through Week 6 in building a basis for understanding the scientific research on meditation. He (and the course) demonstrates what can and cannot (presently) be scientifically proven about meditation. One excellent example: Two trained pianists were told to learn a complicated piece of music, one with the piano, and the other only in his imagination. After 2 weeks (I think) of practice, their brains' MRI patterns exhibited almost the exact same changes. Dr. Saron noted that the results are not definitive but still may have implications for the compassion/bodhicitta meditations we do.#4: An interview on ""Buddhist Modernism"", with David McMahan. Very much academic-oriented. One statement, in particular, struck me since, the more I think about it, the more I think it might be true: ""The Buddhist Tantra teachings are not accepted nor are they popular in the West."" For all the Buddhist monastics that visit the USA and the West to grab donations and go back to their home countries, few of them are sticking around to teach complete Tantra classes. The few that do (and do it well) are having a hard time making ends meet. (That's just my opinion, I guess.)There are also short 5-10 minute interviews with Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro (a short ""snapshot"" of the Tibetan take on the week's particular subject, which was often better (to me) than the 90min-long ""talking head"" version ) and Ven. Tsoknyi Rinpoche (""How does Buddhism change in a New Culture"" and ""Benefits and Dangers of Secularing Buddhism"", the TB rebuttal, as it were. He did note that motivation is the key. Bad agenda = bad results, good motivation will cause good results.)Have I noted the course is FREE? So you can take the course, and the following courses, without doing any of the assignments/quizzes. Watch (or download) any video or transcript to your heart's content whenever you wish in any order you wish. (That assumes the courses are not taken off-line at a future date.) Further in the course description is a blurb that may point to at least 3 future courses in ""Mahāyāna, …Vajrayāna, …and a fourth vehicle, which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”."" If the quality of guided meditations (GM) in following classes are even half the quality of this course's GM's, then that's all the reason I need to continue the future classes, too.Course gotchas:#1. That said (other shoe dropping here), the other half of the course was videos of people reading their prepared academic papers, in monotone or semi-monotone voices. (Transcripts are available. I figure I can read a paper in 5% of the time someone else reads it to me in a video. Ugh.) However, they would probably need the voice of Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, B. Cumberbatch or James Spader to keep me awake. To be fair, the content is golden, although the papers seems to be geared to the academic community, rather than the student community. Books and Videos on these subjects are all over Amazon, YouTube, FPMT, Dharma-Documentaries, etc.#2. The Sharon Salzberg (SS), in her interview, brought up an excellent point. She noted that she and a noted clinical psychology (CP) scientist (researcher) (whose name I have forgotten) were at a conference where the issue on the table was that someone was having trouble with ""loving kindness"" meditation as a first meditation class. SS noted that she would instantly recommend the student change to ""calm abiding"" meditation whereas the CP could not change that student's meditation technique to another technique (such as calm abiding) as her research findings would then be invalid. Similarly, many of the non-Buddhist guided meditations that I viewed in this course felt like a physical education or ""How To"" class. Do this. Do that. It did not feel as though they lived the material, just taught it. (Whereas it was patently obvious Dr. Klein & Anam Thubten were definitely ""walking the walk"", so to speak, so were able to speak from the heart.)Interviews I did not watch, that may be of great interest to others, include meditation in the school system by Tish Jennings, meditation in the Business Community (an interview with David Mick), the Burmese meditation tradition in an interview with Erik Braun, the MBSR (Meditation Based Stress Reduction) with Susan Bauer-Wu, and meditation in the legal community with Rhonda Magee.And all that is just the first course. Many of it's ""failings"" may just be my karmic opinions. The course is worth checking out and watching/reading/meditating on those parts that interest you. In that respect, the breadth of the course content is quite nice and so well done. Grade: B-.",3
6608,"A lot of talking, little content.",2
6609,I learned a lot from this course although I have been exposed to mindfulness meditation in the past. The discussion of Shamata project and research findings are enlightening.,5
6610,"The content of this course was superb. The level of detail and the connections between traditional teaching with modern science and western practice was very helpful, and much appreciated. The interviews and additional content on practice and historical significance was wonderful. The neuroscience content was presented very effectively, with just the right amount of detail needed here, and the critique and straightforward way that the research was presented was masterful, and so much needed in today's cult-like vision of meditation. I look forward to the other 3 segments of the course.I would recommend putting the transcripts of the lectures together in a more easily readable format, then use the videos by Dr. Germano to highlight the issues presented rather than just reading.",4
6611,a miriad of diferents point o view.a lot of valuble information to drive the practice.,5
6612,"The course is very detailed, focused, comprehensive and very well organized.Although i gave the course full five stars, there are a few things that can be better. Firstly is the time frame for every week, that is, to my opinion, unreasonable for someone who wants to really study the material.Secondly is that in could have been served in a bit more engaging manner.Thank you very much!Guy",5
6613,"After being bored to death by his first highly complex and involved analytical/historical lectures, I skipped over every video that Prof. Germano lectured in. I'm not sure if his later videos were great or not, and they were supposed to be ""foundational/historical,"" but the rest of the course was extremely educative and enjoyable for a beginner like me, and Prof. Germano's lectures were not needed for the graded quizzes.",5
6614,", The course was intense, challenging and extremely rewarding.",5
6615,"I enjoyed and benefitted from some of this course. In particular I would highly recommend the Meditation Labs, the Science of Meditation videos and the short presentations from the Tibetan Buddhist monks . But I think the creators of this course need to be a lot clearer about what their aims are in that part of the course which Dr Germano presented. Since this was he was presenting the main overview of Buddhist content it was particularly disappointing that his presentations were so bad.I understand that there were difficulties in getting the course up and running from the various delays in its starting date and the change to its title and perhaps Dr Germano's role was more affected than the other lecturers. However it's pretty damning when he manages to to be so off-putting to so many of the students, going on the discussion comments. For my own part, I've studied and practiced Buddhism for more than 30 years and I am left with little sense of what his aims were for his lectures.To be more specificDr Germano's Presentation:-he read from what I presume were lecture notes but more likely he was reading from an academic paper. the language was pretty turgid.-he could have just provided a PDF of his paper / notes for us to download. That would have been much more helpful as presumably it would have had some structure to it. doing that would have enabled him to use his video time in a more creative way.-MOOCs are wonderful audio-visual opportunities but he had no slides or illustrations at all. The few text headers which appeared then disappeared in only a very few seconds and sometimes did not relate directly to what he was saying at that time.Dr Germano's content: the amended title was Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. This is a complex subject which encompasses many layers of meditation practice culled from historically earlier Buddhist traditions. Can I suggest that any future version of this course includes the following:-include a video which presents the main aspects of the historical development of Buddhism. There was some mention of this in Germano's material but he did it from the Tibetan point of view. Surely what a modern day presentation needs is a modern impartial historical analysis of the subject. It's not as if there aren't plenty of academics and practitioners who are active in this field.-it's confusing to describe Tibetan Lesser Vehicle practices but then illustrate them with Pali text sources, modern Mindfulness practice, and modern Brahma Vihara practice all of which have emerged from the modern Theravadin tradition.-it's also perplexing to include information about many modern Theravadin teachers (Sayadaw, Goenka) in a course apparently not about them.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the videos about Sayadaw and the interview with Sharon Saltzberg, but I am left in the dark about just what differences, if any, there are between them and Tibetan meditation.Overall I think this course was offered prematurely. Much of its content was enthralling, inspiring and very useful practically. However much of it was not.",2
6616,"wonderful course, LOT of material that you need to go through number of times to digest.the work is totally worth it.Provides insight into a very distant and complex world view we westerners can learn a lot from.",5
6617,An interesting class that traces the origins of Buddhist meditation and the Western usage today. A nice dovetailing of research topics covered to attempt to link measurable changes due to meditation practices while trying to maintain a good control group; not easy.,3
6618,Excellent course on the Lesser Vehicle. I am really looking forward to the next course!,5
6619,"The content of the course is amazingly rich. I've particularly appreciated all the interviews.The science was also very interesting, although at the end (starting from week 4 if I remember well), the result don't seem so convincing. But it is still really amazing. (May I suggest to try to use Machine Learning algorithm to analyze the huge amount of result from the retreat project, they are getting pretty good at facial recognition and analysis.)The contemplative labs were an interesting plus.The only caveats is that, although the content presented by Germano and Schaeffer is amazing (and precious to me), I think they could improve the presentation. I would suggest to consult with a specialist in communication who will be able to point out what could be improved and how. I feel that without that, the communication objective will fail (as reported by most students including myself). Here are a few points I have noticed. Complex background create a distraction, especially when the reading is monotonous, it's preferable to have simple neutral background, like a library. Reading in a monotonous voice is not engaging for the viewer. Dandling around and all sort of gestural distractions don't help us focusing on the content. Sentences are too long and use too many technical words, two things that any communicator will immediately suggest to drop especially if you are targeting a large audience. In one video the background was nice (a forest), yet the noise of the bird were too loud compare to the voice. Plus there was many cut in this video and almost every time the camera had moved from its previous position creating yet another distraction. But don't get me wrong, I have appreciated this content, I just felt that it needed a huge investment from my part to be able to grab it into memory and learn from it. This is the reason why I haven't graded this course with 5 stars. I think that if the speaker could improve this part it would facilitate the students work and improve greatly the overall learning.",4
6620,"I thought this course was a scholarly perspective on the Dharma, which was fantastic to learn, in particular with the efficacy shown by studies. Hope to see more of these courses in the context of the other Buddhist vehicles.",5
6621,Great,4
6622,"A thorough academic, philosophical, exploratory & experiential introductory treatise on Tibetan Buddhism that is already proving to be of incredible value to me. I was at first pretty overwhelmed my the sheer volume of lectures on here but when you get into the swing of it it becomes apparent quite early on that the large amount of academic conceptualizations are not the most necessary to become totally au fait with & that these are in fact followed up by a spectrum of other articles which are more philosophical, contextual and relatively up beat, as well as some experiential guided meditations etc.What's become more apparent though is the fantastic faculty behind this & the incredible work being done by them as well as other colleagues in the field. I am extremely impressed by the depth of investigation, research & organization.Extremely glad I took the course & look forward yo the forthcoming ones in the series. Higly recommended for ANYONE with a genuine interest in Buddhist thought.",5
6623,"I am absolutely honored to have been privileged enough to take such a fascinating course on something I'm so passionate about. Dr. Clifford Saron was my favorite part of the course by far; his methods of articulating his teachings, for me, were the easiest to understand and the most engaging/interesting to follow. I will definitely be using the information I've reviewed in this course in both my present and my future. Thank you, to everyone with Coursera & the University of Virginia, who made this MOOC possible. I'm eternally grateful.",5
6624,A wealth of information - a true resource for anyone interested in the subject matter.,5
6625,Most of the interviews were very interesting and useful addition to the lectures. Prof. David Francis Germano questions were of good standard.,4
6626,"I could barely get the videos to work. The information was great, what I could get to, anyways.",3
6627,"I am afraid this is only two stars from me for now. It is a course with great content and a lot of potential, but the way how it is delivered can be greatly improved to make it easier to understand and more engaging. I just hope the team do not give up, but improve this to be one of the best courses on Coursera - it can well be!",2
6628,All courses have their pluses and minuses. This one is a gathering of many of the leaders in this field and is a wonderful overview of the land. I would like to say that the interviews were priceless and while the lectures were a bit dry when lsitening to face to face interactions I was struck by the level of intelligence and dedication of all participants. I am waiting for the next installment.,5
6629,A very interesting course. I look forward to join the next course!,5
6630,Needs to be more engaging.,2
6631,not very good audio.,1
6632,Very poorly structured. Purely academic and dull as dishwater. Buddhist meditation is a profoundly beautiful tradition but there is no beating heart here. I gave up quickly.,1
6633,Very good a bit too academic by times but otherwise a goldmine for anyone interested in the science and context of buddhist meditation,5
6634,I waited a long time for this class to start but now that it is here I find it impossible summon enough will to pay attention to the lectures. As a retired teacher I have more of an ability to stick to a class than many but life is too short to wait for this class to perk up. The professors seem very knowledgable but their teaching methodology leaves a lot to be desired.,1
6635,"The content is great, I think the delivery could be better, and there was a great deal of interesting but difficult and for me peripheral stuff about how the brain worked. Nevertheless, even this had me wowed at times. I have learnt a great deal from every aspect of this course, and am greatly looking forward to future courses, as you have promised!. A",4
6636,As a beginner to the subject... I feel like I know even less if that was possible after just the first few weeks!! I plan to start again sometime in the future and see if I can figure things out in this course.. after I learn about Buddhism somewhere else first!,1
6637,"As a buddhist, I feel upset of this course. I expected it to be teach in a better way, with more lectures, PPT presentations...there ought to be a better way of explanation.",2
6638,"This was the first MOOC I ever signed for and I wasn't disappointed. Far more complex, detailed and demanding than I had expected.... which suited me perfectly.Although brilliantly researched and scripted, Professor Germano's detailed input is spoiled by his unecessarily academic style. I found that his tendency to accumulate endless lists of adjectives had an unfortunate hypnotic effect.I very much like the material presented by Kurtis Schaeffer, especially his contribution on the development of Buddhism in the US. His interviews were well-conducted and his remarks always to the point.Interesting - and again complex material from Clifford Saron who managed to caputre the attention of my rather non-scientific brain. Very well presented material and a pleasure to listen to him.The input from the Tibetan participants was more accessible to non-specialists, straight to the point and very refreshing.The work done by the meditators was brilliant and probably what I had been looking for when I registered for the course. I feel that I now know just enough to pursue the practices on my own. It all feels very new, a little bit scary, quite exhilarating and luminous.Some of the interviews were more interesting than others but they all contributed to broaden the scope of the course.I only give 4/5 to the MOOC because of the poor quality of the subtitles. Not being a native speaker and not used to hear American English, I had to rely on them. They were so bad that, at times, what was written was exactly the contrary to what was being said. Hardly any proper names or foreign words were spelt correctly either. Beware !The course has introduced me to a new world and I will definitely pursue my new-born interest in Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. I will also sign up for more MOOCs in the future. Overall an extremely positive experience indeed. I am looking forward to seing you again for the 'Greater Vehicle'.",4
6639,Meditation is an amazing practice and can change and save lives. I reccomend that more people spend a few minutes a day becoming who they truly are.,4
6640,"The guided meditations were wonderful, but the introductory lectures for Weeks 1-5 were redundant and boring. These lectures could have been much shorter and would have been equally valuable. Dr. Clifford Saron's lectures were interesting.",2
6641,"Wonderful in it's details as well as in the general picture of all aspects of Buddhism, both in secular and spiritual context.",5
6642,Far too academic. Nothing of substance but lists. I'm not here for monotonous lectures.,1
6643,"THIS IS COMPLETE ""SERENDIPITY ""Thank you to your FABULOUS TEAM {*.*}",5
6644,Excellent course. Buddhist philosophy taught at its deepest and most profound level possible in the span of five modules.,5
6645,great material and very interesting and wonderful research material,5
6646,"I was looking forward to starting this course, but so far, checking through the delivery of the first 4 weeks, I can't see spending time voluntarily following this. There is no doubt a lot of work put into this, but it is painful to take part, so no thanks for me.",1
6647,"In week 4 of this University of VA course. Course curriculum is structured methodically, backed up by longitudinal research conducted by several of the primary course instructors.Some of the lectures need a bit of work on the presentation side. The covered material and breadth of study is significant and does not lend itself easily to the Coursera lecture format.",5
6648,"Speakers sound so monotone and dry that they leave an unenthusiastic impression of an incredibly fascinating subject. Some video lectures and writings are so unnecessarily verbose they cloud what is being taught. Frustratingly fought my way through the lessons and failed to clearly retain what I was trying to learn from Prof. Germano. All apologies to the professor for any harshness, and I MAY try again one day, but not now.",2
6649,Extremely interesting course for all. It has changed my thinking.,5
6650,The introduction is great. After that it's unbearably boring.,1
6651,Badly taught,1
6652,Excellent course. I thoroughly enjoyed the scientific advancements and studies presented throughout the course.,5
6653,"Extremely dry, academic style presentation, could use a LOT of work to make it appeal to others in the future. ""Lesser"" Vehicle is also considered an insult in many circles. Not a good title for a class.",2
6654,A simply outstanding course! Truly laudable endeavour on the part of Coursera & The University of Virginia,5
6655,"Joined this course as I was really interested in understanding meditation itself from a scientific perspective. The monotonous drone of the instructors combined with the super low volume that one has to strain to hear, the extra extra long essays which read like one long chapter less novel, the videos which extend what could've been covered in 5-7 minutes to nearly 30, all take the interest away. Unclear if this was intentional & intended to enable participating students to be more patient and tolerant of imperfections around them.",1
6656,boring,1
6657,This is a rather usefull and actual course !!!,5
6658,Learned so much. Mr. Biss is an excellent teacher.,5
6659,"Insightful travel throughout Beethoven's music writing style, and more generally on musical structure of piano sonatas before and after Beethoven's contribution.",4
6660,Very nice time spent with an talented person... Highly recommend,4
6661,"organized, insightful. Mr. Biss clearly has a passion for the music which comes through in his teaching,",5
6662,Incredible class.,5
6663,Thank you very much.,5
6664,Really interesting. Highly recommendable.,5
6665,"In-depth lectures about Beethoven's life and music. I'm still not a Beethoven fan, but I appreciate his music now.",5
6666,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was presented with great knowledge and passion, and despite being full of musical terminology and detail, it was always accessible to me as a non-player. I learned so much about how this wonderful music was structured and composed.",5
6667,This is a great class to understand Beethoven. Thanks.,5
6668,"This was an enjoyable course taught by someone who is obviously not only a superb pianist and musician but also completely in love with Beethoven's piano music. The reason for my 4-star rather than 5-star rating was that I felt the teaching would have benefited from a few visual aids as well as demonstrations at the keyboard. As Mr Biss appeared equally enthusiastic about the music of Haydn, perhaps we might look forward to 'Exploring Haydn's Piano Sonatas' in the future?",4
6669,"I have finished this course and I highly recommend it. I am a musician moving from the rock and jazz genres into classical music and have been taking a number of classical/opera related courses. This one is a standout. Take this course, you will be happy you did.",5
6670,Great course!,5
6671,Although I have completed the course I still go back to it to listen to Prof. Bliss teachings.,5
6672,"Fascinating trip through the marvellous Beethoven sonatas.Although I love them since many years, I'm very happy to see that It's always possible to progress.Many thanks Jonathan.",5
6673,Enjoyable and enlightening. I found prof. Bliss' straight forward lecture style very concise and his insight and passion for the material clear.,5
6674,"Love love love this course!!!Jonathan Biss is very well-acquainted with Beethoven's sonatas. His explanations are beautiful and I love how thorough he is! He goes through the fine, minute details of Beethoven's sonatas without sacrificing the zoomed-out view of Beethoven's life and influences as well.Besides that, Biss is an extraordinary pianist and clearly loves and admires Beethoven's sonatas. I hope he'll keep on adding to this course!",5
6675,"Great course for a beginner like me. It's an introduction and exploration of the adventurous world of music and musicians; passionately delivered by the expert, Mr Biss.",5
6676,The course is rich in information and I appreciated the fast pace of the professor's lectures (especially his enthusiasm and passion for the subject which I found delightfully infectious ha) - however I feel that for many people his very quick elocution was perhaps a bit of a minor hindrance for those that process information a touch slower. I definitely plan to resume this course as I enjoyed the professor's manner and passion.,4
6677,"In discussing modulation in classical music, one of my classmates said that Beethoven's piano sonatas are bizarre in their styles compared with those Romantic composers like Liszt and Chopin. I don't agree with him, but I don't have enough knowledge to analyze Beethoven's work. The course titled ""Exploring Beethoven's Piano Sonatas"" provides such a high-level overview of Beethoven's Piano music, I should say Thank you to the instructor!",5
6678,I have always wanted to learn deeply about Beethoven's Sonatas as I listen to them on a daily basis.,5
6679,"For a Beethoven fan (or dare I say geek) this is an absolute joy. I'm 'only' a listener, but passionate enough to take on this wonderful journey through these piano sonatas with Jonathan Biss, he's just awesome and makes me want to come back over and over again ... for more. Please keep adding.Thank you for this opportunity to learn more about Beethoven and his music.",5
6680,Outstanding introduction to Beethoven's Piano Sonatas. It has sparked a great interest in me for these pieces.,5
6681,"Going through it for the second time this summer. My all time favorite Coursera course, and I've done almost ten...",5
6682,In depth analysis in a field that I was not familiar with. I recommend it to everyone whether they have an interest or not.,5
6683,"This course was excellent and I enjoyed it, but I was done with it when they offered more lessons and was very annoyed to get multiple emails telling me I needed to complete the course. I did complete it, as originally offered, and think that should be noted on my record.",5
6684,"MORE, MORE, MORE PleasePlease make another MOOC, I am dying to hear from you again, Mr. Biss. Thank you for making this learning experience so enjoyable. Your playing is wonderful, and your explanations are clear and concise, making this course a real pleasure to take. Great job, and please do it again!",5
6685,I like this course a lot so far. Thanks Mr. Biss.,5
6686,Absolutely loved this course! Jonathan is amazing and he has inspired me so very much. I can hardly wait for his next series.,5
6687,Fantastic course! Very informative.I think the second part of the course was improved. Jonathan demonstrating more on the piano (as opposed to just explaining -- as he did more of in the first part) was a great addition.Looking forward to Jonathan's next concert!,5
6688,Inspiration!,5
6689,"Fantastic, excellent musician and incredible mastery of the subject. I enjoyed it enormously.",5
6690,"Outstanding course! Tremendous insight, extremely well articulated, and explained with real passion and depth! Would highly recommend this course to anyone who appreciates this kind of music; particularly those seeking to understand Beethoven's idiom better.",5
6691,Excellent course. I think I began to understand and — what is most important for me — feel the music. Thank you!,5
6692,"This course provides an excellent overview of Beethoven's most important piano sonatas and the innovations that he made. It is the point of view of a player, not a musicologist, and this makes the lessons quite enjoyable and closely related to the music itself. I loved it.",5
6693,"I have taken many courses by now, however this course brings to mind the fantastic ""A brief history of time"". Both go above and beyond my wildest dreams, leaving my expectations so far as to be unable to recall them.I learned not only about Beethoven the composer; but developed a greater appreciation for him and his music, for his predecessors and those who followed his footsteps, the sonata form and many other forms, and perhaps more important to ponder about the nature of music itself and it's relevance in our life. His presentation of the musical question, quotation, program music, and the notion of ""jokes"" exposed and explained a musical paradigm far broader than affective or cerebral qualities.It stems from these observations that there is a very rich and capable language with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this case, the history of Beethoven's sonatas is then a very close look at a critical point in the life of this language that binds multiple stages into a consistent whole.This subjects quasi universal nature, spans multiple cultures and allows us to look into snapshots of the experience of life. And this presentation has provided me with the necessary training to be aware of this and also to slowly delve further into this subject. And I find this in itself to be a very significant reason why to study music in the first place.My deepest thanks to all who made this great work possibleWither music?Most certainly :)",5
6694,"I am only halfway through this course and it is already a favorite out of the handful of courses I've successfully completed through Coursera. Jonathan Biss's passion for the subject matter brought me from an infatuation with Beethoven to a full-on heed over heels love. I am a vocalist, I was classically trained as a child (lately a lot more bluesy) but do not have a strong background in theory. Most of what I know is through an innate understanding of harmony, structure, etc. This is whetting my appetite for musical structure and thoroughly illustrating that musical analysis is so very exciting. There really aren't words for how much I love this course. It has really brought me joy.",5
6695,"Wonderful course, thank you professor Biss",5
6696,"Amazing course! I can now understand Beethoven's Sonatas in a much deeper level, as well as how performance and innovation evolved throughout time.",5
6697,Fantastic! Thanks so much to Mr. Biss and Coursera.,5
6698,Wonderful journey getting to know these sonatas with a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. Thank you for this.,5
6699,For true Beethoven lovers and others as well,5
6700,"I am learning a interesting things about the sonatas I love, even though some musical terminology is above my head. I would prefer a course, where the musical terminology was explained first (tonic, dominant, key, harmony and so on). Still, I am grateful for what I could glimpse though.",5
6701,Exciting and Clear !,5
6702,"Very interesting historical background and a paced, clear presentation of the musical techniques employed by the pianists. Very enjoyable if you are a classical music lover.",5
6703,Fantastic course. Thank you so much for sharing all this wonderful insight into Beethoven's works.,5
6704,"Excellent course. You can go into great detail in understanding the intricacies of the sonatas or you can simply come away with a deep appreciation for Beethoven, his works and what goes into playing them.",5
6705,"Great lectures, great playing, excellent and enjoyable course. Thank you, Mr. Biss and Curtis Institu",5
6706,Extremelly interesting! I am so unhappy I don't have enough time now to attend the course properly.,5
6707,"I highly recommend this course to anyone that wants to look DEEPER into music. Believe me, after you are done with this course. You will see classical music completely different.",5
6708,This course was excellent. I was exposed to many sonatas I was not familiar with before this class. Jonathan Biss is a great musician and did a great job of highlighting the key points of the sonatas presented. I would like to see him cover another composer.,5
6709,Jonathan Biss is really Beethoven Geek of all Geeks. Thanks!,5
6710,Enjoyed this course. Looking forward to listening to Beethoven's piano sonatas with a slightly more educated ear.,5
6711,"A fascinating course for any classical musician, or keen listener of classical music. Jonathan Biss' passion for his subject, his rich language and his emotion-laden playing combine to engage the participant, so that one is left with not just a better intellectual understanding of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas, but also, a much greater appreciation of the pieces themselves and the man who wrote them. Thank you to Coursera, Jonathan Biss and the Curtis Institute of Music for making this course available.",5
6712,"excelent course, gives me the inspiration and motivation that i need!!",5
6713,Amazing course!!! Would definitely recommend it to everyone.,5
6714,"Prof. Biss is outstanding, clearly articulating his interpretations and providing exceptional playing. Loved the level of detail both technically and academically. Far and above other Coursera music offerings I've sampled. More please.",5
6715,thanks.,5
6716,Excellent course. Jonathan is a great pianist and a great instructor.,5
6717,"It was an introduction to some really beautiful pieces of music, and a look under the surface that helps appreciate them more; even those that are well known have hidden depths.I don't have much formal musical education, but I feel I learned something from this course, and enjoyed it greatly.",5
6718,"Thanks for the Wonderfull information, I love it.",5
6719,Jonathan Biss is a superb musician and instructor! This course is a wonderful resource!,5
6720,"Just superb. Is there a better, more passionate and lucid guide to this extraordinary music than Jonathan Biss? The whole series is utterly compelling. It's made me listen to and absorb the sonatas in a whole new way, and it's opened my eyes to the full scope and scale, beauty and humour of Beethoven's genius in a way I'd never imagined possible. Can't wait for more new lectures in the future.",5
6721,"I'm not a musician and have little knowledge of classical music, but I figured that an on-line course would be a great way to gain some understanding of this type of music. Mr. Biss made the course both enjoyable and educational. While I wasn't able to comprehend all of the concepts, it wasn't for lack of a clear explanation and demonstration. Somehow, I managed to pass all of the quizzes and came away with an appreciation of Beethoven's music.",5
6722,"Perfection, both in content and execution!",5
6723,"A great pianist and teacher, bravo Maestro",5
6724,"This is a great course! I Highly recommend it to anyone like me struggling to find meaning in musical harmony in general. The interest in sonatas is a great side effect! And the way Mr. Biss emphasizes and explained the passages, this is just extraordinary. I am looking forward to any new courses from this great teacher!",5
6725,"This is, out of all the courses/studies I have done in my whole life, my favourite of all time. Mr Biss is a a wonderful lecturer.",5
6726,Very insightful and inspiring,5
6727,"I rediscover the beauty of Beethoven's piano sonatas through Mr. Biss clear, interesting and engaging lectures. I like the fact that he himself is a performing pianist that made all the demo very enjoyable and convincing.Also, I did not quite understand the greatness of Beethoven's late sonatas before and now I almost cannot pass by a week without listening to one. Thanks for introducing me to the world of late period of Beethoven. Now there is much more to be explored: string quartets, piano trios, missa solemnis, etc.",5
6728,Instructor is amazing! The best!,5
6729,"I am about three-quarters of the way through this course and I am completely enamoured with Beethoven in ways that were impossible before taking this course. I love the depth that Professor Biss imparts without ever getting pedantic or overwhelming. I have now listened to all 32 sonatas, some several times more over the past several weeks and I feel so fortunate that I can love this music in a deeper, more passionate way because of the understanding I have gleaned from this class. Highly recommended for all musicians and music-lovers.",5
6730,great teacher,5
6731,Pretty good!,5
6732,"Excellent, great fun, Jonathan Bliss is a top teacher, thanks !!!!!",5
6733,Very good demonstration and analyse on Beethoven sonata and raise your interest in further exploring classical music,5
6734,A must-take for all classical music lovers.,5
6735,"This is one of the best music courses in Coursera. Jonathan Biss is not only one of the great players of our time, but also manages to simplify and deliver outstanding quality content for learners in any theroetical",5
6736,Excellent course! I learned a ton and the challenge level was just right.,5
6737,"Great, very satisfying to understand what's going under the hood of a computer.",5
6738,Excellent intro to basic computer architecture.,5
6739,Great course! Thanks a lot,5
6740,This course is one of the best ones I've ever taken on Coursera.,5
6741,The best course of this segment,5
6742,simple with challenges,5
6743,"I cannot recommend this course enough! Although I have developed software professionally for almost 20 years, some areas beneath the high-level languages I create software with felt like dark mysteries. This course was extremely helpful in illuminating many of those areas. If you develop software professionally but did not graduate college with a computer science degree, I highly recommend this course to you.",5
6744,Perfect :),5

6748,I got principles of computer,4
6749,"This is a brilliant course for those who want to learn how computers really work. It takes a bottom up approach to build a computer all the way from logic gates to the CPU and the complete architecture. You get a tremendous sense of satisfaction running a program on a computer that you built.This course is especially useful for people interested in working in computer architecture or systems, but I would recommend it for everyone studying or working in computer science and engineering.",5
6750,"I only audited the course due to shortage of time. A complex topic like computer hardware architecture can't be taught as simple and nice as like in this course..I took many moocs and this is one of the best. I also loved the end of the lectures named as ""perspectives"" which is about the questions of students mostly ask about the relevant week's topic. Thank you lecturers a lot and a lot and a lot..",5
6751,Great course! I had tons of fun. Thank you!,5
6752,This is an Amazing course !! A must take for cs enthusiasts,5

6769,Amazing course. It helps very much to get an idea of the computer hardware.,5
6770,Very succinct. Not a lot of hand holding.,5
6771,Very interesting and well-structured course. Manages to explain something very complex by splitting it into manageable sections. I am enrolling in the second part as soon as I can!,5
6772,"The HDL syntax I felt was a bit fiddly, and sometimes hard to find the relevant technical details such as language definitions in the videos, but overall a very interesting and enjoyable course. Happy to pay for it despite it essentially being available free.",4
6773,"First Class Systems-approach Introduction to Computing! Together with the corresponding Textbook ""Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"" published by MIT Press, this is probably THE BEST and most comprehensive course and Intro available - for both self-educated and degree-educated Knowledge-Seekers - into the vast subject of Computer-Science/Electrical-Engineering. Very practical and hands-on, but still conveying the relevant theory. A great second Computer-Science course, e.g after the traditional ""Introduction to Computer Science"" and before a dedicated Algorithms module.",5
6774,"Really Awesome Course, loved it !!! Very thankful to the instructors for sharing their knowledge, passion, efforts and time. I learned a lot from the course and it helped clarify a lot of concepts. Thanks again.",5
6775,Great course!,5
6776,"Just the course I always wanted to take. I've been working for some 5 years in IT as a programmer with a background in mathematics. Since my education in university did not cover the low level details of how things really work deep down, I was always befuddled by the mystery of computers. This course helped to clear things out for me! There is a bit less mystery to it now, but even more admiration. Thank you very much Noam and Shimon for making things so accessible. I am looking forward to building a compiler in part II!",5
6777,Fascinating course. Where is the part two?,5
6778,Very fast paced overview of the computer hardware. Excellent material with a focus on the practical side.,5
6779,"By constructing a computer from its foundational components, this course demystifies how computers work. You gain insight into how your code is executed by the CPU, how the CPU manipulates memory, even how it works with additional hardware components such as your monitor and keyboard. After going through the first part of the course, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how the code you write runs on hardware. If you are the curious sort and enjoy peeling back layers in order to figure out how things work, you should definitely go through this course.",5
6780,This course helps me learn the fundamentals of CS.,5
6781,"This course is worth every hour you spend on it, it is by far the most accomplishing course I took.",5
6782,"I am eternally grateful for everything you both faculty Shimon Schocken, Noam Nisan taught me.Really before the commencement of course I was thinking that this course will be boring.But after I started watching videos, the ultimate guidance and effort done by all the members of this course inspired me a lot.The course content is awesome. I am very happy that I build the computer. It was really amazing experience.Once again millions of thanks to teaching and non teaching staff.Thank YouHimanshu Tiwari",5
6783,"I loved this course. Some criticism though is that the course doesn't go into detail on the architecture of modern day computers. Also, some things were simplified in the course, which is a little disappointing. However, I did get to build my own computer, and I learned quite a lot from this course, so it was definitely worth spending time taking the course.",4
6784,"Very good, complete, and well thought-out course. Enjoyed every lesson and task. Gives you an excellent overview of what a computer essentially is. 5 stars!",5
6785,"Wow, super challenging and interesting.Loved it, now I understand the fundamental of computing ALU, RAM, ROM and Nand :)",5
6786,Learned a lot of thing that I was previously unaware of.,5
6787,The course is good. I just do not give five stars because we have to pay to atempt pass.,3
6788,11/10 On IGN; Must have for people who want to make computers,5
6789,The most amazing online course. I love how it is project based. Everything you learn is straight away applied to building the project and it it made me look at so many things in life differently due to the way it breaks down the concept of abstraction.,5
6790,It's an excellent practical approach to understand the inner workings of a computer at a very low level. The instructors teach at a comfortable pace and cover in great detail even the simplest of topics. More light could have been shone on how and why the control bits produce the desired output in the ALU.,5
6791,The best ever~!,5
6792,It was really enlightening to build a simple architecture from scratch! Thanks!,5
6793,thank you for such a great course :D,5
6794,Simply great,5
6795,Fun course to take. Makes you realize how much we depend on abstraction in our world. A few notes on documentation (your own code) and version-control would complete it...,4
6796,just what i wanted,5
6797,"I love this course, I think it's one of the best I did in the past few years, most of the content are material that I read over twenty years ago, but the style and projects in this course bring the subject to another level.The course is fun, and by the end of it I had a working virtual computer from the components I built, running machine code from the assembler I wrote. The course is fun, it's clear, simple to follow, and the instructor are great.The truth is I felt a little sad that the course ended :). Looking forward for the second part of it.",5
6798,"I love you guys, Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, for this tremendously successful course! I never thought I could acquire even a basic understanding of the inner computer structure in less than 6 weeks and honestly at first I had doubts if I would be able to finish it and now by your help we have created yet another computer!You are the brilliant example of how a proper education system can hugely intensify the students' learning abilities.I Surely recommend this course to everybody regardless of their study/educational background in order to ""demystify"" the computer in their minds.However, I need to remind others that the course sometimes really challenges you and you might need to think a bit hard to solve the projects. Nonetheless the teaching materials are extremely sufficient for resolving any kind of problem you might have, given you spend enough time on it!I am eagerly waiting for the second part of the course.My heartfelt thanks goes to everyone, Coursera and any other individual and instructors, who has made this wonderful course available to the world!",5
6799,"Very good cource, but only first part of it",4
6800,Great course for understanding the bottom layer of computers,5
6801,"Amazing course, with the perfect ratio between depth and abstraction. For me the computer is no longer a magic box that does tricks.",5
6802,This course is awesome and fun and very rewarding. I learned so much about how computer memory works! Pointers make sense now that I understand the basics of lower level computing.,5
6803,A very amazing course for the computer system!,5
6804,nice lecture to know someting about the elctronics ...thanks...,4
6805,"Great course to understand how the computer ""black box"" works at a fundamental level. Looking forward to the 2nd half of this course!",5
6806,"This is an amazing class! The software and unitests provided worked seamlessly - just as described. The lectures excellent pedagogical expositions. The class has also made me appreciate the intellectual beauty of computer science; I used to think programming was somewhat boring and hack-ish, especially compared to mathematics. I'm looking forward to the second part. Also, the book is just as good as the lectures!",5
6807,Fantastic course! Everything you've ever wanted to know about the computer is taught here! Cannot wait to start the second part!!!,5
6808,The first part of this course gives excellent introduction to base computer hardware principles.,5
6809,"The course is well structured, leading the learner through project based learning from one conceptual level to another. It's completion was very satisfying and I look forward to From Nand to Tetris II.",5
6810,I have never wondered building a computer by simple logical elements until I found this course!This course is simple and funny.,5
6811,It was a great experience building a computer hardware from first principles. I am wondering if I can build this architecture on an FPGA@,5
6812,"This is a great course that explained every thing from gates to actual PC very clearly.I'd recommend this course to any one who try to fresh up computer science basics.I only have a small suggestions, the four week taught about machine language, fifth week taught about the CPU-ROM-RAM architecture. From the first three weeks, (in my own opinion) I feel the order should be reversed.",5
6813,Must take course for all technology and computer enthusiasts.,5
6814,This help me learning some basic concepts in CS. It worths to take!,5
6815,Amazing and well structured course work. The end was challenging but it was worth it!,5
6816,"Fantastic. Quite difficult for me, but I learned the material along the way. Fantastic way to train yourself to think logically and parsimoniously. And the computer knowledge is invaluable.",5
6817,"Challenging, Eye-Opening, Fun, Well made, Well run, and Well assesed",5
6818,Excellent introduction to how computer works.Looking forward to part 2 of the course on Coursera!,5
6819,"Fantastic course. I recommend it to anyone who not only want to know how a computer works, but want to build one out of transistors.",5
6820,"An amazing course that gets you started with whats inside a computer, and how it works.",5
6821,"I have completed the course and I must say it is one of the best courses I have taken because it is very clear all the information. In addition, the development of the projects allow you to learn in a deep way.",5
6822,one of the best courses one can take to understand how computers are build from ground upThe course is organized in such a way such that its very easy to understand and relate,4
6823,"This course is an outstanding survey from logic gates through assembler. At the end you will have the gate level design of an elementary CPU and RAM, and the mysteries of machine code will be revealed. I am an older learner returning to computer science after a twenty-year absence. I had previously been exposed to this material, so I was refreshing my knowledge. It took me about 5-6 hours per week. If someone is brand new to these concepts, the syllabus may move a bit fast for them, and they should expect to spend some additional time to absorb the material. It is an outstanding survey course that together with part II will help you understand how all the hardware and software layers of a computer system fit together. I recommend this course without reservation.",5
6824,Really good one. Would be 5 stars if there was better support.,4
6825,"This class teaches some very important subject regarding computer hardware design and low level languages. I found it very challenging but not too challenging, except the 4th and 5th week which were very difficult to complete.",5
6826,This is a brilliant course. The information is presented in a structured and clear manner. The assignments are very interesting and really test your logical thinking.I am looking forward to studying the second part.,5
6827,Had A lot to learn from this course ... Thanks,4
6828,"Very interesting course for those who want to fully understand the inner workings of a computer.However, the utilities offered are a bit neglected. Be prepared to fight bugs on your own.",3
6829,"Excellent,fun and highly very organised course. You'll be amazed just how quickly you ""build"" your very own computer, from the humble NAND gate to a working machine.",5
6830,One of the best course on introduction to computer. Easy to follow. Well documented problem sets and instructions.,5
6831,"I was skeptical of HDL at first, and wished that the course had used a more industry-friendly language. I'm glad the instructors addressed this in the course. The HDL language used in the course is simple enough that hardly any time is ""wasted"" learning it.",4
6832,"Computer system internals, hardware and software architectures, concept of abstraction, divide and conquer method, the fun of building hardware, and the fun of writing programs, all combined into this course, in an organised way, I can't think of a better course and a better teaching!",5
6833,"Amazing course, I can actually build a computer from scratch. I love this course!",5
6834,"A fantastic course that should be considered as a requirement for any one working as a software developer. The tutors did an excellent job here, the course material was clear, and the assignments were fun and rewarding.I can honestly say I've now built my own computer from simple Nand gates and it was fun and educational.",5
6835,Excellent course! I'm extremely looking forward to part 2.,5
6836,Used this course to bolster my study group as we went thru the book. GREAT experience!,5
6837,Simply takes your breath away to learn how computers are built from the ground up. This is like an art appreciation course ... but for a crucial technology that permeates every moment of our modern lives.Starting with the simplest pieces and moving all the way up to a functioning computer you will build nearly all the pieces with your own hands. You will learn how hardware is designed in the real world by actually making your own gates as well as an ALU - an absolutely delightful experience. You will then get your hands dirty with some assembly language - seeing how symbols are translated into bits before moving on to put together your functioning computer.The course is great because there is very little yak-shaving for you to do ... most of the boring stuff is actually handled by the software provided in the course. You get to focus on the joyous acts of discovering things for yourself and putting together the pieces of the puzzle at every stage.Many thanks to the professors and their team for taking the time to put this course together and for making something that's very abstract for most of us into something that's concrete and accessible.Thank you!,5
6838,"Fantastic course. I found it challenging enough to keep me interested, but not so difficult that I got annoyed or frustrated. However, a lot of the material I found to be a re cap of concepts I was already vaguely familiar with having worked in IT for 20 years. A true beginner would most likely find some of the concepts difficult to start with - but keep at it!",4
6839,This is a concise overview of computer science. If you could only take one course in this whole field. This would be the course to take.,5
6840,It gets more and more fun,5
6841,Very insightful and awesome ....I am enjoying it !! Great work and efforts from both the professors ....respect ! Can't wait for the next course from NAND to Tetris II ...! :),5
6842,Excellent course with a layer-by-layer explanation on how to go about building a modern computer.,5
6843,"I've always been wondering how people make circuits work the way they want it to, and now it no longer puzzles me! Thanks guys for your work on this great lecture!",5
6844,Very useful but I'm waiting for part 2.,5
6845,awesome class,5
6846,I think this is one of the BEST class on coursera.Instructors use a very efficient and easy way to teach the essence of computer architecture.,5
6847,"Great glass! The assignments were well designed and a lot of effort was put in to making sure students could understand what they were supposed to do. I've found that good assignments are were most other courses are very lacking. Having good assignments is what really motivates me to finish a class, and it's what helps me verify I've actually learned something.",5
6848,"This is one of the best CS courses I've taken so far. It's great to see how easy it is to build a simple yet powerful computer on your own, and it has given me for the first time the feeling of really understanding what's going on at the low level.The complete course is centered about the project of building a computer, so there are no quizzes and only few theoretical background lectures here. If you want a hands-on introduction to computer engineering, this is the way to go.",5
6849,"This is in my opinion the best course on computer hardware for beginners ever created anywhere, to date. Get ready to think and work though. It's not for lazy people that want it easy.Completing every module is a rewarding and satisfying experience and the teachers are great.",5
6850,"Good starting point but very slim on the 'why's and the hardware is quite unlike anything you'd find in real life. In addition, I feel they leave too much unsaid and rely on visual comprehension far too much. I had to use the book to figure out the last two weeks. Overall, I did learn the more practical sides of hardware that other textbooks failed to convey. If they would add a Status register and break 'branching' into a separate instruction then I'd be happy with the CPU.",4
6851,Very interesting subject. The course is very well organized and clearly explained. The projects are progressively challenging and all of them are engaging. I have learnt a lot of things.,5
6852,Excellent! I have my degree in EE and thoroughly enjoyed this trip. I highly recommend this course.,5
6853,Excellent course with the brillian presentation.,5
6854,This is a course makes people learn what was actually happening in the computer. It inspires me profoundly.,5
6855,Excellent course! I thoroughly enjoyed it.,5
6856,They claim it is the best computer science course ever. It is true!,5
6857,The projects/assignments are awesome. Lots of fun. Very clear lectures.One thing is reading how the Computer works from books/articles. The other is to actually build a working CPU/Computer from nothing but Nand gates. Can't beat that.,5
6858,"Simply awesome. By no means does this course teach you everything about building a computer but it introduces you to the subject better than any other course that I have ever come across. It gives a voluminous amount of detail about low-level computing but the instructors took great pains to do so in a very accessible and easy manner. Thereby, the magic of low-level computing is made available for everyone regardless of who they are. Beautiful.",5
6859,The projects are to die for.,5
6860,"I am a chinese student. I still can't express my words in English freely , so I just say thank you.",5
6861,"A very good self-contained course which takes you from ""knowing nothing"" to ""building your very own virtual computer"".",5
6862,This is the best MOOC I have ever taken & it competes with brick & mortar courses. It is a truly *amazing* MOOC and I cannot wait until Part II comes out.,5
6863,Great hands-on course with exhaustive and self sufficient material,5
6864,Excellent pace and instructors.,5
6865,"Excellent best online course ever, very didactic an fun. It motivates you to continue learning and complete the course",5
6866,Amazing Class!,5
6867,The greatest lecture ever made for computer composition principles!,5
6868,I submitted homework for week 1. I get an email telling me I did not submit. Then week two the course makes references to material not covered in week 1. it looks like a week is missing between week 1 and week 2?,1
6869,"Excellent course, didactic and informative. Every step is natural and easy to understand. Recommended to anyone who wonder how they work this incredible machines.",5
6870,Boring course!,1
6871,The course is fantastic. The teachers are both very good at explaining the concepts and the project assignments. The experience of building a computer from basic logic gates is enlightening and the course material is very good and straightforward. I also bought their book (The Elements of Computing Systems) which is also very good and I recommend. It's a very rewarding experience. We really learn how computers *work*.,5
6872,"I read the book before, it was translated in Chinese. It's really a good book and in very good topic.",5
6873,Having none prerequisite is quite surprising indeed.,4
6874,you get really great intuition about how compu,5
6875,brilliant lecturer. i love the analogies. they make everything much easier to understand.,5
6876,fantastic course so helpfull,5
6877,"It gave me you a comprehensive and up-do-date vision of the state of the art on current studies in cosmology for a high school level audience. Very well done. Thank you, professor Murayama, for this unvaluable initiative. My science students, at elementary school, will benefit enormously from the knowledge I've got through your lectures. Greetings from Brazil. 8-)",5
6878,interesting course,5
6879,Very interesting but too many informations on a short course,3
6880,Just brilliant. This is one of the best Coursera courses I've ever done.,5

6884,My jaw dropped at the gluon field. Amazing!,5
6885,I loved this course... It made me realise how small we are yet how big!!! It helped me understand various aspects of universe and also about quantum physics...Thank you so much for the course..,5
6886,"This course is interesting and well presented. The lecturer injects humour as well as a sense of curiosity into the topics. However, I would have liked to see more mathematics and derivation of justifications of theories. Much of the material was presented as mere facts or observations with little attempt to show reasoning which leads to the conclusions.",4
6887,The course is well laid out and Professor Murayama is an excellent teacher. His way of teaching has definitely increased my interest in the universe. I now prefer to read articles and watch programs about universe than any other.,5
6888,Loved every minute of it. Thank you!,5
6889,Very interesting course. The Lecturer explained things in simple terms making it easy to understand,5
6890,"Great professor! great sense of humor, comprehensible way, essential data. Loved it!",5

6900,I am so grateful for this course. It is very informative and well developed.,5
6901,very good course with a lot of news from the field of science,5
6902,"this course introduces the whole story from big bang to Dark Matter and Dark Energy, with a few math. It is not hard for any one who got a high school degree to understand the details.",5
6903,This course is the best suited for the people who truly wants to understand the working of the universe and what will happen in the future. This was the best course I have experienced. The teacher was fantastic and it was enjoyable throughout.,5
6904,Amazing Course!!,5

6919,Very interesting and helpful!,5
6920,"Very informational, I enjoyed it very much. A great add-on to physics class.",5
6921,Best on the interest for this topic,5
6922,"This course is very nice, just needs more details in the lectures to explain some difficult points in a simple way. And the homeworks could be much comprehensive to help students understand the rational of each theory. Although this could require adding more weeks but up to 8 weeks is worth doing as this course is essentially taken by students with research goals (like me). I hope we can see some improvements in this course year.",4
6923,Very interresting course! I have learned a ot about the Big Bang processe and the inflation.,5
6924,"Very informative, and he keeps it interesting.",5
6925,"100% worth your time ! Astronomy is my passion, and I wanted to apply my knowledge elsewhere while at the same time enhancing my understanding for the subject. I hope to do some form of Astronomy/Astrophysics course at university and this online course has been perfect in helping me to discuss my extra work/reading around the subject.",5
6926,Excellent course!Great updated information with crisp explanations from professor Michihiro Kandori,5
6927,"Very interesting, deep enough without using very difficult maths (although I think too much for a person without a minimum background in spite of claiming the information of the course it is not necessary)",5
6928,an amazing class :),5
6929,"Great course, actually interesting, scientific and very useful for those of us that like science and want to comprehend a little more about our universe",5
6930,"A bit too much math in the questions, although it seemed (in the videos) that we could skip it. I'm very visually oriented (and also a MENSA member), and I would have explained more with graphics. Or at least not have to much 'equations' in the questions.",4
6931,I've learned a lot of new stuff in this course.,5
6932,Simple. Informative. Neat and smart.,4
6933,Wonderful course with excellent explanation,5
6934,I love this course!! Great PowerPoints and presentation. It is very up to date. I am glad I got to binge watch this class. i would hate to have waited a week to see the next episode. The professor was fantastic! (He has a very subtle sense of humor that you have to watch for. ) I highly recommend this class for those interested in the topic.,5
6935,"Very complex topic and also the one of most curious one too. A very good amount of knowledge one can gain about the big bang and our universe. Straight forward lectures through images and animations. but I feel that some of the explanations were very twisted in the 3rd week although I understand that the subject itself is one of the most complex topic of the research and these are scientists and not teacher but there is this room for the improvement. Also the quizzes were too easy and very straight forward and don't test the understanding of the topic very much. I am a very big supporter of the Coursera, I have stared many courses but due to some reasons couldn't complete any, this is the 1st course that I followed till the end. Thank you Coursera for this wonderful opportunity.",5
6936,Extremely informative and well designed for beginners,5
6937,its a very basic course helps you a lot if . you don't have much background in the feild,3
6938,"Excellent course with clear, not too technical, explanations. highly recommended.",5
6939,"I get lost by the end, but was a great course, now I understand alot of things",4
6940,Not what I expected,1
6941,"That's an amazing course! very good,vrey meanningful",5
6942,Excellent piece of work for beginners.Created interest in the subject.,5
6943,Amazing course. Gives a great feel of what has been discovered and what is going on in latest research about the science of universe. I highly recommend this. And I will be waiting for more advance course.,5
6944,"Prof. Hitoshi Murayama has Scienced the course out of dark matter! Amazing introductory course for young aspiring minds. Professor has taken a cosmic ride through the greatest minds of our history. It is structured beautifully like an atom, into four lectures, each more thought provocative than the latter. Can be completely understood by anyone with curiosity and high school knowledge of basic science.",5
6945,The professor is one of the best professor in the whole world in my humble opinion.,5
6946,"Prof. Hitoshi Murayama gives a clear presentation on the most important topics in modern physics. As I am a physics student, I really appreciate Prof. Hitoshi Murayama's class.",5
6947,A very complete course of the throughout history of the mystery space! Rate it!,5
6948,Great course!,5
6949,This course offered a well organized and clearly articulated presentation to understanding of the complexity of the universe. I would highly recommend taking this class.,5
6950,The course is for a novice. There are some mathematical treatments which need understanding of physics and mathematics of 12th standard in India. But they are in small parts and can very well be skipped.I would advise any curious person who wants to know what's going on in the frontiers of physics esp cosmology to take this course.I would love to see a Hindi translated version of this course or some similar course which will be very beneficial for Indians with little or no expertise in English.,5
6951,"A great course for the beginner to get their teeth into, very well taught and interesting.",5
6952,"It was the best course I have ever come across about universe. The course is divided into four lectures of increasing complexity. It begins with every day phenomena like day and nights, seasons and takes you to solar system, galaxies, stars, particle accelerators, Higgs boson, dark matter, dark energy to big bang and inflation theory.I would recommend this course to anyone who is curious to know about origin and possible fate of our universe.",5
6953,Very interesting.Professor Murayama explains really well lots of things with... few times. This course is very intensivebut so interesting.If you like astronomy you cannot miss this one!,5
6954,Immensely enjoyed a highly technical course diligently presented in a very comprehensive way. It answered many questions I had in my mind but had not been answered,5
6955,Very interesting programme about astronomy and physics.,5
6956,I loved this course (in spite of my poor performance in the mathematics related parts of the lecture). The presentation made dense and difficult concepts understandable.,5
6957,"そんなに教授に感謝Interesting course!What are we made of?How about having devices in capturing and measuring our souls when we have stopped breathing?It could be in a form of energy returning to the universe, could it be the Dark Energy?",5
6958,"an excellent course,only one problem: it explain a little bit of equations",5
6959,Very interesting course and good information. Could you more explanation and exercises to bridge gaps for those that are new to the field.,4
6960,very nice course. I found the way the material was presented interesting to follow and learn something new even I had cosmology before.,5
6961,Its very informative but not attractive.,3
6962,More interesting than science fiction! 😁,5
6963,"The contents of this course will be familiar to anyone who reads popular science books. The course is useful mainly for pulling various strands together, but don't expect much depth.",3
6964,Very good course.Gives a strong knowledge of space and universe to those who seek that knowledge.,5
6965,"Excellent, I dont know a lot of word because I speak spanish if the course was in spanish it would be amazing",5
6966,"really good, with a bit of humor thrown in here and there",5
6967,Thank you very much!,5
6968,Very nice lecture(s)...,4
6969,"A great course from a Great Professor.I really enjoyed this course and i am kinda sad that is over.It was even irrelevant to my field of study ,but professor Murayama made it so easy to understand like i have been studying this subject my entire life.I highly recommend it to everyone!! Thank you so much !",5
6970,Very interesting! The flow of the subjects was very helpful,5
6971,Introduces many interesting topics.,4
6972,clear explanation and is helping a lot to broaden my general knowledge. Thanks a lot,5
6973,Overall a really good course. I learnt a lot about astronomy from this 4-week course.,5

6996,"Dear Professor Murayama!Thank you for the amazing course—simple to perceive, short, and yet filled with lots of interesting information!As a person with very little background in this area, I started to understand much more about our wonderful world—with the help of your lectures.Best wishes and regards,Alla",5
6997,It was not difficult to follow the course in terms of the mathematics. I wish there was a follow up course on all the mathematical side to the things explained here. The materials were arranged very creatively with a good flow which made a lot of things clear to me than any other thing I have read or watched up to this point about this area of physics.,5
6998,"I really enjoyed this course a lot. However i am not familiar with Math, i could pass this course with 92.8% and for me this high grade.Thanks a lot for Tokyo University and Prof.Maruyama who exerted a great effort in this course , and Also i wanna thank Coursera Team too, because made this course available to students who live in arid countries.Ahmed Osama Abdelnaeem.",4

7003,A great review of current advancements in physics presented in a manner comprehensible to people with basic physics knowledge. Only issue was with some slides which had text in colours which was difficult/impossible to read for my type of color blindness.,4
7004,Really nice course. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in entry level physics of the Universe.,5
7005,Excellent teaching :-),5
7006,course contains subjects of interest and curiosity.,5
7007,"Very impressive approach to make such a complex topic accessible to everyone.Physics often requires being able to simplify concepts at first so they can then be pushed to larger horizons later, and Pr Murayama does it brilliantly.",5

7019,It was a wonderful experience.,4
7020,Entertaining way to learn about an interesting subject.,5
7021,"very good course, although the very beginning is very basic. exceeded expectations. I would have liked it to have the video transcripts, as i like to have another source for learning and understanding the contents. i liked the professor and his attitude. i think some things are left kind of unanswered or implicit, which for someone who is not directly involved with the subject confuse me. maybe Q&A sessions with the professor would also be a good idea besides the recommended transcripts. overall it was very good",5
7022,"From the Big Bang to Dark EnergyA very interesting survey of the universe from the big bang to the possible future of the universe. Professor Hitoshi Murayama presents the course in a very unassuming and welcoming manner. The idea of dark matter is explained in the problem of galaxy rotation speed, and the idea of dark energy is introduced to explain the strange idea that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. The idea of discovery of Higgs, dark matter, Cosmic background radiation and atom formation related to the time history of the universe is also introduced. Future telescope/spectroscopic experiments are given in the last lecture, and can be further looked at on the web with more understanding from this course.",5
7023,"Very interesting. If you were curious about what is happening in this universe, you should take this course.",5

7031,Excellent course. One of the best. Related complex subject matter in a understandable way for those who have some basic background in this area.I took this course twice. Liked it better the second time. Highly recommended.,5
7032,"Very good to get general Idea about the big bang, higgs boson, dark matter, dark energy, and antimatter. How were they discovered and what are their effects.",5
7033,"This was one of the best courses I have taken on Coursera. The professor was articulate, the material was organized, and the graphics were clear and helpful. I completed all the quizzes and completed the course. I do not want a certificate as I am well past the employment phase of my life. I enjoy the courses to help keep my brain's neurons connected. I would enjoy any other courses that Prof. Marayama teaches.Joem D. Phillips",5
7034,"An exciting adventure through the most recent discoveries in the worlds of astronomy, astrophysics and related sciences. Without requiring any mathematics or physics skills, the course is useful for amateurs like myself trying to understand the fundamental questions and possible answers about the origin of our universe, its laws and structure as well as its fate. It is a pleasure to follow professor Murayama clarify these wonderful subjects.",5

7134,This course has opened new doors in my life. Thanks Coursera!,5
7135,definitely worth following..,5
7136,Helloto all how works in this course thank you,4
7137,"My course 3/4 in this specialization is still incomplete because the questions had wrong answers in the module quizzes and it was literally taking HOURS to complete the quizzes because you had to guess which one of the wrong answers would be correct this time. The questions rotate through slightly different questions each attempt so you can't simply use elimination on each attempt, YOU GUESS EVERY SINGLE TIME. IT'S LITERALLY 100% LUCK! I thought maybe course 4/4 would be better but nope, same problems here. I've wasted over 6 hours in total trying to pass these broken tests and I'm completely over it. I also reached out to chat support, they went through and said they couldn't find anything wrong and couldn't help me and a refund was impossible because it's past the refund date. Even though I paid for 2 broken, un-proofread, time wasting courses. Also, in course 4/4, the math tables in the videos are staggered all over the place and looks terrible. Seriously an issue of someone not even looking at the video before publishing, would have taken less than 5 mins to fix for the entire course. Also, every time a ""checkpoint"" question is supposed to pop up, nothing happens. In every single video, they're all missing. I've used Coursera for a few other courses and thought they were reliable but this makes me think otherwise and I feel like such an idiot for paying $200 for this COMPLETE GARBAGE. Other people in the forums have shown they have the same problem posted over a month ago but nothing. Please, someone from Coursera get a hold of me and help me resolve this ridiculous problem.",1
7138,"Extraordinary, expecially for the updated content and innovative way of communication",5
7139,"I love the way this class was structured with short videos and readings - the concepts were clearly articulated and easier to absorb in this format. I found the content interesting and very relevant to my work in education, health promotion, and development.",5
7140,"This course is a capacity strengthening one for civil society operators, quite enlightening",5
7141,A very interesting course.,5
7142,Another great social norms social change online course.,4

7152,very informative and interestig course,5
7153,"Nothing much to learn, the videos were rather short. There's no lecture on computing the angles and the full features of the framework. The framework wasn't updated for Swift 3.",1
7154,waste of time and money,1
7155,"Why there is no ""minus one"" star? Because one star is way to much for this course. Stay away!",1
7156,"In this capstone project, you're given a framework to work with, and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria. The problem is, there's very little instructions or support, so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said ""do whatever you want"" and walks out of the door. Overall the specialization feels ill-organized and of questionable quality, and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums.",1
7157,"After the first week, the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums. The capstone project itself was disappointing, I learned much more from doing my own app in class #3.I took the Coursera Android specialization, which was eons better than this. I would not recommend this iOS specialization to anyone. I would never again take a MOOC from U of Toronto.",1
7158,A Wortlhy Course,5
7159,"This capstone project was a huge disappointment to me. The course caption stated that this would be where we would use Location, Design and Usability, and Persistence and Settings to build a high quality app. Also stated is that ""you’ll apply your skills to create a fully-functioning photo editing app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch."" Earlier I have also read that we would be allowed to build an app of our choice or according to teacher's specification. That text now seems to have been removed.Anyway, none of these promises were kept. Instead we got something like 20 minutes of lectures in total for the whole four weeks, all on a simple framework to track face features. Unfortunately this framework isn't very competent, so there's only so much you can do with it. Most of us have only placed some static images and simple animations on top of the face shown in the camera view, and that is actually enough to get full marks according to the form used in the peer review. How does that even begin to fulfil the promises of the caption?We have paid as much for this course as for the previous three. There should of course be a similar amount of lectures on more advanced topics like current best practises for UI design, the Location API which was promised, and other interesting things that provide the building blocks for a state of the art iOS app. For a real cornerstone project, I expect that more than 4 weeks would be necessary in order to be able to build a good app, since many of us are doing this on our spare time.I feel sad that I had the misfortune of signing up for this course before it was made, but hope that you will take our collective criticism and make a good course out of this for future students.",1
7160,The capstone project had nothing to do with the previous three courses.,2
7161,I'm kind of disappointed with this last level. It isn't really what i expected.,3
7162,This is a joke.,1
7163,"If I could, I would rate it 0/5 stars.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT pay and enroll this course. And you will be disappointed if you do. There, now you have been warned.This part of the specialization has been put together in a haste, without effort and absolutely without any care of teaching. I'm completely shocked and disappointed.In other words:It is a complete joke and a sad excuse for a MOOC. Shame on you University of Toronto!Yes, harsh words, and here's why:The course description does not reflect the contents nor the final assignment. Face tracking? That's pretty far from what I expected from this when I paid $284 for the specialization.In total, there is only 25minutes of video lectures. Really? That's it? It's way too little for a capstone project course.Staff does not care about learners's concerns. Zero effort to respond in the discussion forums. It takes days before there is any response at all.The assignment descriptions and requirements are sparse and vague. Why are we doing face tracking when the description talks about location apis and ""putting it all together""?",1
7164,"The course has been released way too early, clearly it lacks most of its content and what does exist isn't working properly either.",1
7165,"Expecting more hands on experience with big data frameworks like Hadoop or Spark. Instructions of the final assignment is very confusing, you don't actually know what it really want you to do until you go through all the Q&As in the discussion forum, which is really wasting time.",3
7166,I really enjoy learning for the first time after a long time. I will keep learning.,5
7167,In this great course the instructors cover a broad range of topics related to big data models that is perfectly designed.,5
7168,"Good information overall, but the ""peer graded"" assignment at the end is poorly designed and seems unnecessarily arbitrary. Not a clear value add over a ""final exam"" format to justify waiting days for someone to ""grade"" your work. Instructions for this assignment are poorly written and unclear - for example, completely NOT clear you are asking us to identify a primary key versus stating there is no primary key, etc.",3
7169,It was a great course from the best place in the world and best instructors .,5
7170,I've learned a lot of things about data models and new ways to process the information. I want to learn new knowledge of big data because I want to apply in my professional life,5
7171,Nice course to describe the traditional data modeling (RDBMS) as well as various semi-structured and un-structured data modeling and management of the systems (Batch and Streaming data processing),5
7172,Excellent professors! Everyday was a new learning experience!,5
7173,good cource,4
7174,very nice and interesting course i recommend it for anyone start new in big data,5
7175,Thank you!,5
7176,good course,5
7177,Very well explained,4
7178,Very Good course,5
7179,Best course on Various Big Data models and management systems.,4
7180,IMHO it's better to reduce the scope but provide more details of key technologies. Final assignment is not well explained.,3
7181,Course material is very poor and did not give much support for doing assignments.,1
7182,"Too simple, no programming, just theory.",2
7183,Very informative course.,5
7184,I thought this course was great. It gave a phenomenal overview of the tool sets out there and some good practical hands on with them. This series of course is a must for anyone wanting an overview and some hands on in the big data world,5
7185,"I don't feel this course is always very clear. I Feel that I usually am missing the big picture. I follow it in details, but the pace does not match in terms of how you can view the big picture of it.",2
7186,"Course is very good, and highly recommended.More practice on this course will be appreciated",4
7187,1. The course is very general and high level introduction.2. During the lectures there are some examples that in some cases are presented as very small images and briefly. I personally could not understand some examples presented in week 5.3. I found the hands-on lectures very helpful. I wish there was more that would delve into more examples in more details.4. The course was very overpriced given the amount of information offered compared to other courses I have taken at coursera.Thanks.,3
7188,This course captures the overview of Big data modelling concept in a very simple way. I found this course very useful. Instructors are good to explain the concepts. Though it would be good to add one or two (add-on or optional hands on exercises) handson for graph and tree data modelling.,4
7189,The course content was not very appealing. Explanations were not that engaging. What I really missed was the actual practical aspect where you don't work with command prompt but an much more user friendly interface that is more up to date with current standards.,2
7190,Not Very relevant and detailed as the previous course. The content is not as clear and simple as previous course,3
7191,The final test has little to do with the course. You must do extra study to respond.,3
7192,"Simply another great course within Coursera courses, thank you very much.",5
7193,This course is designed well,5
7194,Good Course!,5
7195,Some concepts can be simplified by using comprehensive examples.The course is overall great!,4
7196,"Pretty good overall, although some exercises are a bit difficult to understand from the descriptions and instructions given, some graphs and initial reference documentation for exercises might help",4
7197,Peer Assignment is not too clear,4
7198,Assum lectures! Cant except better than that challenging assignments.,4
7199,"There has been very few on-hands training. It's still very very at an introductory level. At some points it goes very deep, for example with the vectors for a document, but with the rest stay at a very high level. Open an excel sheet can not be considered training ...",3
7200,"This course offers very useful high level overview of concepts and ideas which make you feel confident in the long run. However, the course is extremely basic and does not go deep beyond the high level concepts. The hands on exercises are boring and do not engage students. The course needs to be improved to make it more useful for students. This course is not very worthy of the money.",3
7201,Very helpful,5
7202,"The course takes a broad approach to the subject.What I miss: the study material should provide more and better organized (theoretical) information (e.g. on topcis like database design, data structures, etc.)What I like: presenting of current software projects around big data",3
7203,Great course which gives you insights into Big Data Management and various product differentiation used for Big Data,4
7204,Great course! Although I think it would be a good idea to have all the HANDS ON instructions downloadable as a PDF to keep in personal files.,4
7205,"Too high level. Last assignment too ambiguous, peer assessment was completely random and not reliable to pass the course.",2
7206,"The course a materials are interesting and with significant value, same comment on the teachers, this would be perfect if the third party(the VM) is working fine, I can't say I'm happy about the course where the frustration is probably the right word describing my feeling right now, wish me luck for this week, I might pass might not ......",2
7207,The course gives an extensive overview of the topic. I have particularly appreciated the hands on section.My recommendation to all the students is to not overlook the hands on and create some personal notes and code archive to quickly review those topics.Some particular good learning for myself: lucene. I have used lucene at work both directly and wrapped within elastic search: in both cases I was not going deep in understanding the data model behind lucene and concepts like similarity. You can leave like that in the vast majority of the current jobs where lucene is a third party system invoked upon needs but understanding the model behind was simply much more easy than I expected.,5
7208,"LEarned a lot, wasn't easy but it was manageble for someone like me who has no IT background",5
7209,"Overall relevant and clear presentations. Course material quite general, but I guess this is expected from an introductory-level course.Peer-reviewed assignment's instructions can be clearer.",4
7210,So useful and focus on main basic aspects.,4
7211,Really nice course learned much about MongoDB and Spark,5
7212,"I really wish I could give this course more stars, the content is great and well delivered and at a perfect level for someone like me who last worked with big data sets when 20Mb was absolutely enormous and Windows 3.1 was cutting edge technology. But and this seems to run across the whole specialisation, support from the course team varies between very patchy and none at all. Technical questions aren't answered for days if at all.",3
7213,The way for going through of material and classes is now better.,5
7214,"I wish the courses are more project oriented. This is a very good introduction but, atleast you could provide some optional projects or some tasks.",2
7215,Modeling is the start and gives an insight how to choose the correct model for a big data project. The correct choice of the model spells success for the project. Many data models were introduced and the hands-on exercises were helpful in better understanding of the concepts.,5
7216,The level of the exercises and quizzes don't reflect the content of the course.,3
7217,"it was a little too slow but is ok, specially with beginners as me.it can be a little bit more interactive or didactical.",5
7218,"Reasonably good, but less structured and organized that the first course.I hope the next one will be better on this aspect.",3
7219,Interesting. Sometimes a little bit overwhelmed by a lot of information within a single video but it gives you an overview of what is big data modeling and management systems.,4
7220,The course was very informative. One suggestion would be to include more practical exercises as it would help in internalizing the concepts better.,4
7221,"The content of the course is very good, but the definitions and explanations are not straight forward.",3
7222,This course is a valuable introduction to Big Data Models and Management Systems for a variety of data types. The hands on exercises and company use case examples provide helpful context and application of the concepts. This knowledge also provides the learner with more confidence in navigating big data conversations in a professional environment.,4
7223,Good to understand Big Data.,5
7224,"As a manager in an IT consultancy, I can't justify sending my personnel through this course, even at $69 per course. The amount of information gained is very thin and does not move one toward being productive.",1
7225,Thanks for the education! :),5
7226,Just about okay. Wouldn't recommend to pay for this.,3
7227,Course is very much intresting and i learnt so many new things.,5
7228,This was my second course of six. It was so theoretical but at the final exam it required so much exercises. I propose enrich the course with exercises and hands on,3
7229,"Great introduction to management systems. I would have more hands on exercises for the final week, but it was a great course overall.",5
7230,"Very good material and overview. However, still a little bit too basic. Fundamental management systems hands on should be much more intensive.",4
7231,"Poorly designed assignment on data modeling did little to expand my knowledge on the topic. Which is a shame since the individual lectures were well done and very interesting. The ""Pink Flamingo"" peer-peer-reveiwed exercise needs to go.",1
7232,Good course!,5
7233,The last peer review is really hard to do. Hard is because the wording is very ambiguous and not all understand how to review. There was a guy who answered with SQL query. This is hardcore since we have not learned that yet...,1
7234,"Peer-graded assignments are bad for multiple reasons. Most important one -- If I'm paying for this course I expect my work will be verified by skilled people, not by other ""students"".",3
7235,Not worth your time or money.,1
7236,it was nice but a bit complicated for beginner though i like it,4
7237,"Although Content quality was good, the content is too much less and could have been easily integrated to first course or other course in specialisation.Secondly Quiz were not challenging ,it was just too easy to pass, and this actually takes away the very reason they were employed in this course.",3
7238,Not too much useful and practical knowledge. full of basic concepts,4
7239,"Very basic, the 'hands on' exercises are not very hands on and do not actually add much value",1
7240,"it's pretty good. I learn a lot, but some information is not enough, for example TF-IDF, and vector model",4
7241,Interesting course :),5
7242,More practical exercises should be recommended.,3
7243,"A good course taking into account that it does not require previous knowledge. I am giving ""only"" 3 stars because for a basic (no previous requirements) course I would expect much more additional readings. On the other hand, if you have programming or database experience you will find some topics too ""basic"".I have liked it more than the first course on the specialization but I would expect more details (I think general topics are well explained).",3
7244,"3.5+ star course. I hope by studying the following courses, contents of this course prove to be more practical.",3
7245,"hard to follow not because it is difficult, but the lecture is only slides, texts, reading slides, very boring and not so many hand-on instruction. only thing i remember is the instructor's face after finish this class. Dont know why you add this into such a good specialist.",1
7246,Wonderful course! Definitely worth taking!,5
7247,1*(star) to the professor very difficult to understand the professor many times. Even the subtitles fail sometimes to present what he says. 5*(star) to the content of the course and especially the tool used to explain and learn the BI concepts. I have already recommended the tool to couple of companies.,3
7248,Great,4
7249,"A lot of the lecture material is unclear and does not fit with the content I've learned from other BI books, lectures, and experience. Additionally, the quizzes don't seem to test for real-world BI knowledge, rather they test for the ability to interpret the instructors fairly unique views on some BI topics. Furthermore, the additional readings need to be culled significantly, it looks like someone just googled BI topics and then copy and pasted the links they found. Please prioritize the additional readings highest value to lowest value and then post only the 4 to 7 reading that rank the highest. A pairwise comparison process may be useful when doing this.",2
7250,Good course! Although there was some grading issue for last assignment,4
7251,The course was very helpful,4
7252,In this specialization it are all good documented wel explained courses,5
7253,good course,4
7254,Awesome course with complete coverage to BI concepts in general and in specific to microstrategy,5
7255,"Great, many resources..",5
7256,Awesome course,5
7257,Basically just a product demo and the lecturer was very hard to comprehend.,2
7258,"Compared to the other Coursera course I attended ,this one is by far the least useful one. The instructor is super brief and his slides are mostly made of a list of acronyms!I would not recommend it until they make some serious changes to the content and presentation of material.",1
7259,"Actually, It's a great course from Theoretical perspective and from practical part",5
7260,If you want to learn BI basics and Deep insights into how BI works and you want BI as a career go for this course.,4
7261,cool! :,5
7262,I recommend it,5
7263,Loved it.,5
7264,Difficult to understand the video lectures at time but really useful content. Excellent further reading sections at the end of each module.,3
7265,Excellent content and references to additional materials.,4
7266,"Concepts covered a slightly harder to comprehend than with the previous courses in the specialization. I found myself having to keep going back and forth through the lessons in an attempt to understand. You really do need to read up on other sources to plug in some gaps, but overall it is a good course that covers a lot.",4
7267,Orsum concepts.. much delighted after doing it,5
7268,"It was a wonderful experience of taking such a valuable course from a well qualified instructor, presentation was great, detailed and well understood. Thank you again for your time, effort and being the great contributor of this type of education. Many thanks again.",5
7269,This course need Michael Manino.,4
7270,Great,5
7271,Thanks for a great course,4
7272,"this course is great in concept. but the reality was disappointing and will have to improve. the professor gave lots of links to interesting external materials. but his prepared lectures were much briefer and consisted mostly of presenting bullet-point lists. as a result, i found myself studying just to pass the quizes and not to actually enhance my knowledge. :( given the high standard of the other courses in this specialization, i'm sure it will be better next time....",3
7273,Very good course. We had the opportunity to learn some business issues and find ways to develop solutions via BI systems. We had also good lessons,5
7274,Good Course,5
7275,"Direct and briefed to the point.new thoughts , Tools and Ideas :)",5
7276,"Content of the course is very good, useful and interesting, I greatly appreciate the knowledge delivered. But assignments could improve:-All module assignments seems mostly focalize on using Microstrategy tool. In assignments, i would like to see more exercises so that students learn through practice of business cases. For example, I prefer the way modules are organized in courses 1,2, and 3: concepts with examples, practice exercise, then assignment through similar exercise + a quiz.-In last assignment, there was no suggested solution(s) for the last question, i think this is missing for a good understanding.",3
7277,I did the free part of the course. It was too simpleI did other free MOOCs that had much more.The videos were like reading a book. The subject is interesting and there's some potential to the practical part of the course.I only did the first 3 weeks,3
7278,"The Course is well laid out with plenty of assignments that allow you master the BI by using Microstrategy. Thanks to professor Karimi, it was by far the best BI course that I have ever taken.",5
7279,Great course! The professor is very knowledgeable and the materials are up to date with the current industry trends. I was able to apply the concepts learnt in this course in my job.,5
7280,"lecture too focus on the theory that not very useful on business world. The BI tool ""microStrategy"" used in the homework is too slow and crash from time to time.",1
7281,"It is a really good and well structured course. Initially, I felt the structure is not making me think but when I reached the end, in summative project, I realized how much I have learned. Anyone with basic IT background would be comfortable with the course. Learned various concepts of Business Intelligence; and microstrategy as a BI tool is good for analyzing. After I am done, I am going to spend more time looking at other tools of Microstrategy and apply those in the capstone course if required. I came across some students facing issues with microstrategy in the Discussion forum but I think improper installation or hardware and software support could be the cause.Thank You, Mr. Karimi.",5
7282,The course has some good technical and analytical understanding of BI tools and application plus the BI project helped me derive useful visualizations. This course has helped me build my analytical skills to a different level which I think is expected in the actual BI industry.,5
7283,The material and the lecture is not so engaging.,1
7284,Amazing course. It taught me how to balance my daily diets.,5
7285,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course! As a professional cook (I run the kitchen for a church in Boerne, TX) I love being able to learn more about my chosen profession from the comfort of my home and being able to share that information with those who work with me as well as put it into practice in the real world. Thank you for providing this opportunity to those of us who cannot attend classes in person and for the wonderful videos and recipes you have provided.",5
7286,Very useful and encourage me to cook healthy food and notice well the ingredients of home cooked food and also the processed food . It also support me because I have a G6PD patient baby boy,5
7287,"It has provided a lot of help for me and my family, I love it and I enjoy every lesson!",5
7288,Informational and filled with great imagery. Clear bullet points makes it easy to digest and learn.,5
7289,I really learned a lot by how to make good choices when shopping for food and how to add in healthy alternatives to food I already eat. I've already noticed a change in eating and spending habits,5
7290,Very Informative Course!!!,5
7291,"Great learning experience, and how to maintain a healthy diet. Thank you.",5
7292,Out children are the future and their nutrition is a important thingfor their development.,5
7293,"Since I was a child I liked to help my mom and my grandmother to cook. They taught me to cook and I learned the traditions of the family. My two younger children were picky eaters, and at the beginning it was very tough to prepare food for them. Now we enjoy together to prepare and eat different types of food. We love our traditional food, but we are always looking for new recipes. This course teaches me how to combine different types of ingredients to bring to our table, every day, more balanced and healthy food.",5
7294,Excelent teacher!.The course is compiled in a very clear way....She is very talented and presents the course with a great charisma!,5
7295,Extremely usueful for familes~,5
7296,"I recommend this course to everyone. It's easy, light-hearted, and you learn a lot from it with out feeling like you're studying!",5
7297,It was very complete. The videos and the pictures were good to understand the ideas.,4
7298,"Interesting content, great stuff for every parent.",4
7299,Good course for living well,5
7300,"Loved the course. Very professional, instructor was very warm and explained complex topics simply. Very nice combination of videos, demos, and lecture. My only comment is that the quizzes do not align perfectly with the lesson. There are numerous examples of being quizzed on something that isn't taught until the next lesson.",5
7301,This course was really interesting thank you ! X :),5
7302,Loved the way the lecture slides are depicted and the short cooking videos [ie. Dr Adam cooking - actually practicing what she preaches :-) ],5
7303,A very good course for starters.,5
7304,"The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition. The graphics and didactic material is very good. I would suggest that Dr. Maya improve on her cooking skills (cutting and chopping), It takes too long to do every task and she must use appropriate tools. also, measurements are very important in the kitchen to be disregarded as she does. Remember, she might be teaching to people that have not cook at all. Cooking without measuring is for an expert or a least for somebody with some cooking experience.",4
7305,"Excellent, I really enjoyed and learned a lot. Thank you",5
7306,"Very informative. Provides lots of really useful information that you can then apply directly to your every day life. I've learned a lot about food and how to easily make better, healthier, choices for my family and I. The cooking demos are wonderful and I've made several of them which turned out delicious. The professor provides a lot of every day information that you can and will actually use and be able to apply to your life. Wonderful course and I highly recommend.",5
7307,Such a great stepping stone to cooking simple and delicious foods. I have been encouraging clean eating gradually with my daughter and she absolutely picks vegetables now that they are presented differently. I would love to see more recipes from Maya to incorporate in our everyday menus.,5
7308,I love Maya! She's so knowledgable and comes off very approachable in this course. The information she provided is also invaluable. Thank you so much!,5
7309,It is a very interesting course. It contains a lot of helpful and new information.,5
7310,Although I don't have children it was very helpful for me. Interesting information about organic food and allergies. Recommend it to everyone.,5
7311,This course is wonderful! Each video is not too long but full with information. You encourage me to choose a healthier lifestyle. Thank you so much. I will use these knowledge to improve my family's health.,5
7312,"I did several online courses about health and nutrition. I really like this course because it is easy to learn the content and the dishes are delicious and easy to make. It is a bit US centric, but that is not really a problem as the issues are in my opinion becoming more global (if they are not already; e.g. obesity).",5
7313,Good course Child nutrition. Thank you Stanford University & Coursera.,5
7314,Just Amazing! Thank you Maya,5
7315,Great general overview of nutrition and cooking for those who are just starting to work on balanced menus for home or group settings.,5
7316,This course offers a great foundation for learning to live a more healthy and sustainable lifestyle. The information is presented in a way that absorbs well between the videos and the visuals along with the lecture. This course has the capacity to change people's lives and it has definitely given me the information and confidence needed to be able to move forward with action.,5
7317,"Accurate , but very basic information.",3
7318,A brief and useful introduction to nutrition and building healthy eating habits from childhood—absolutely worth my time.,4
7319,Enjoyed it but perhaps a little too basic for my needs. Still would recommend if you are not familiar with nutrition.,4
7320,"Really complet course with a lot of knowledge easy to undestand and very visual which it help to focus on the information, Im so glad I took it, no doubt to recomend to parents and people on the health area.",5
7321,"This is a course that teaches us how to cook in a much healthier way, as well as learn concepts of nutrition.",5
7322,Please issue me a certificate. I am ready to pay the fees. Thanks:Devashree Shah,5
7323,Very useful data(information) for everyone!!Lest try to give to our children more natural and healthier food.,5
7324,"lesson helped me understand the nutrients and spicy, foods when cooking for children",5
7325,"it was a nice attempt to get child and parents to enjoy, how to prepare to eat",5
7326,"I don't agree with everything that is being said. For instance, I prefer not to use sugar at all when it comes to cooking for my family. But still, some practical ideas are included and the recipes are easy to cook.",4
7327,Nice but basic.,5
7328,it was really intresting,5
7329,It is interesting and so easy to follow.,5
7330,This course is very helpful for young parents and caregivers.,4
7331,"First online course I finish, I learned a lot from it. It's recommended even if you never cooked before, as it is in my case",5
7332,It´s good but really basic,4
7333,"Some lectures are just right for the public in general but most of them seem to be built from common sense, there´s where I wonder if the American people are so unliterate on food issues. The quality of the visual material is also variable, I am sure that including animation of more appealing graphics would be helpful to engage more people into the course; another challenge would be to prepare more challenging content.",1
7334,Excellent course and very complete. It's a good start to understanding nutrition for yourself and your children. Wish there were more courses on this topic (I took the other nutrition course by the same professor as well).,5
7335,A very good course for keeping your daily eating healthy.,5
7336,"The teaching style is very impressive of Prof. Maya ADAM, very inclusive, very informative.Thank you very much",5
7337,a real pleasure to learn!,5
7338,"You did an outstanding job teaching this class. In another class, sometime I would like to understand things like salt and potassium and their importance. Good job!",5
7339,"This course definitely changed the way I feed my children. It requires more trips to the store, but knowing I am putting healthy, sustainable choices in front of them makes it feel like less of a burden. The way the material was presented was very understandable and made you want to continue.",5
7340,It was great and very motivating.,5
7341,This is a great course and I would refer this course to anyone willing to learn.,5
7342,"It's a great course. The teacher is very friendly. I can even feel her energy through videos. I love the way she taught. She will draw a beautiful and clear picture explain those important knowledge. It’s very helpful to understand those difficult terms. And the children are lovely and cute. I am glad that I have chosen this course, it’s useful and interesting. I highly recommend.",5
7343,Excellent course. I hope I can hear from the book you're releasing soon.,5
7344,I signed up over a year ago. the first time around I got through the first week and life got in the way. The second time around I finished it but due to the app I had to take the quizes again. It was a great reminder. Overall the course is great in helping you change the way we approach cooking at home holistically not only for the kids. I enjoyed it tremendously and would sign up for another course by Dr. Adam,5
7345,"Loved the course, would take a continuation if available. Little basic but with enough info. Great ideas for cooking. Felt it was too based in USA information and some was not really conclusive.",3
7346,Really liked the instructor,5
7347,"Excellent course, the only thing I would change is the meat dishes suggestions.",4
7348,very nice introduction for raising kids.,5
7349,Basic principles of nutrition explained in an easier to understand and remember manner. I definitely took a couple of recipes and key learning points with me!,5
7350,Quite useful ! Easy to understand and nice hits for child nutrition.,4
7351,Very clear and fun. I really like it. Thanks,4
7352,"Excellent course, I've learned a lot about healthy cooking and how to teach kids to eat more vegetables. Thank you!",5
7353,"I found this class to be doable with a 2-month-old infant. I enjoyed the reading. My older kids, ages 7 and 11 enjoyed the videos with me. The class helped our family have many great conversations about what we see at the grocery store and why we cook at home as much as we can.",5
7354,"I passed this course 3 or 4 years ago. After completing the course I feel significant changes in my diet, grocery shopping , my kids food and their healthy snacks. This course gave me a good opportunity to restart cooking and shopping much more healthier. Thanks",5
7355,thank you,5
7356,"Pretty easy, only complaint is that the instructor says the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body. This is not true and made me question the rest of the material in the course.",4
7357,Shes sexy af,5
7358,"Even though I do not currently have children, I felt this course gave a great overview of the basis of nutrition and how to incorporate fresh, whole foods into my own diet and my husband's diet.",5

7407,Not very useful.,1
7408,Was expecting a deeper unsdersting and knowledge of child nutrition and its impact in the health of little ones... too general.,2

7425,This course was very educational. Maya was great at explaining healthy foods and ingredients that her own family uses at home. I was incorporating her suggestions while taking this course. I'm working to include less processed foods and more fresh fruits and veggies in my families diet. I even started to make fruit/veg smoothies for my 8 year old daughter instead of buying her the 100 % juice I bought in the store as a way to provide her with more vegetables in her diet as well as less processed food. Great course! I will be looking for more courses to take that include Maya and her wonderful children.,5

Best of all I believe she did a great job stating all the facts and encouraging people to make smart food choices without being judgmental about it, which is no easy task!I am lucky that I am already doing a lot of the things the instructor suggests for my toddler but the best takeaway I got was to take my child to a farmers market. We went this weekend and it was so much fun! I plan to take her there as often as I can.",5

7477,"making shoping and cooking easier, not difficult, quizzes are great; it helped me a lot when shaping my new diet",5
7478,"First, I would like to say that with the exception of ONE exam, I was able to take all the tests WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEOS. That shows that this is a poorly put together course. Secondly, this course did NOT cover CHILD NUTRITION, it covered general nutrition. There was nothing helpful in regards to meal planning with children (although there was useful information in the Lunch Packing Video.) Although it claims the project at the end of the course is optional, it will not let me complete the course without doing the project. I find that extremely frustrating. This course offered a lot of great information (even if it was a weird combo of factual/opinionated) I was frustrated by the fact that this course is OBVIOUSLY geared towards the upper middle class/rich instead of the the everyday blue-collar family. I will do the project to complete the course but was very disappointed in my first course through Coursera.",2

The reason I kept watching is because of the teacher's exceptional diagrams that beautifully explain complex topics in a simple way. As a teacher trying to introduce my own students to sustainable living, the instructor's style has given me so many ideas on how to communicate these concepts to my own students.Thanks so much for your hard work! I will take your other class and hope to see others from you in the future, hopefully something about GMO's or food access in areas of strife and the long term effects on child development in those areas.",5

7581,"I think this was a great intro course and parents would benefit from it greatly. I wish more of the recipes were vegetarian and diary free (I was in fact surprised that so much diary was part of the recipes). Regardless, a lot better foods than those being served on a regular basis.",4
7582,Very informative and easy-to-follow.Please make more courses on nutrition.,5
7583,very nice n friendly teaching,5

7585,"Very thorough, educational, and very enjoyable. Highly recommended.",5
7586,Very basic introduction and crash course to child nutrition and cooking. For the busy parent/working adult.,4
7587,The course seems like it would benefit parents but does not do much for a nutrition health professional.,3
7588,She is very easy to understand and listen to. I love that some recipe ideas were given and that I could go back into this at my own pace and time.,5
7589,"This goes over basics for how to involve kids, which is great. If you're already a thoughtful cook, it may not have a ton for you as far as recipes go but the information on how we use our nutrients and balancing food is fantastic.",4
7590,good information to our healthy lifestyle,5

7592,"I have not finished it yet, but I love it.",5
7593,This course should be mandatory,5
7594,"I found most of what was presented very interestng. I found that when the lesson on chicken soup and stew was being presented, that you used chicken broth from a box. To get better flavour of your chicken soup, why not just add one cube of beef? Better yet, with your stew, why not add some homemade veggie stock which can keep in the freezer?Overall I enjoyed the course, but if you could address the above issue of chicken broth from a box, i would appreciate it. Also, is there a way to get your drawings from this lesson? Thank you",4

7603,"Easy to follow, and good contents",4
7604,"There was a lot of very valuable information in the course, and I very much liked the general structure. However, maybe it was due to my career and family background, but there was also plenty of information that I had mistaken as common knowledge. Apparently I have more knowledge in this area than I assumed.Overall, this was a very interesting course, and the combination of the videos and smart board graphics helped keep things interesting. I would very much recommend Child Nutrition and Cooking!",4
7605,Really easy and useful. Thank you very much,5
7606,Very much Informative and easy to use techniques.. Liked it !!,5
7607,great and good recipes to make with kids,5
7608,"Very good place to start for beginners with some scientific information. Easy and quick to do food demonstrations, basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand.Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks, but I guess that is what she wants to stress on. No to processed food!! :)) I just wish you kept the discussion boards open, so we have a platform to discuss ideas and exchange recipes.",3
7609,This is great course!,5
7610,"This course provides great information. If you have taken any other basic nutrition courses, as I have, most of the information is review. I found the that info wasn't necessarily specific to children but could be applied to all individuals regarding healthy eating, choosing local/organic etc. Even if you don't have children and want to learn more about healthy eating, this course would be beneficial for you.",4
7611,"Maya Adam, MD is a total inspiration. The course was factual and engaging. information learned was easy and practical to use everyday.",5

7626,"This is a very clear and very well presented course. It covers the science of nutrition as well as the practical aspects of cooking through demos. The instructor speaks clearly and knowledgeably about her subject.I will note that it is definitely a beginner level course. If you already do a fair bit of cooking from scratch and have already read some Michael Pollan books, you may not learn much that is new to you.What it does though, it does very well.Also, the instructor's kitchen is beautiful and I spent most of the lectures coveting it greatly :)",4
7627,Solid information provided in an excellent format by a outstanding teach,5

I loved taking this course.Eventhough I did not learn much new, I got assurance via this course, that what and how I cook for my 2 year old is healthy and the right way. ;)While seeing some of the videos, I found it funny that I actually cook basically exact same way as Mrs Adams.",5
7654,"Amazingly simple yet full of information! This course on nutrition, including organic/holistic options, gives practical, easy-to-use ideas on healthy and enjoyable eating options not only for children but also adults. Recipes given are easy to use or adapt, and tasty as well! I highly recommend this course for anyone who wishes to have a well-rounded understanding of real, traditional (organic, grandma's kind of cooking) nutrition.",5
7655,Very educational and easy to follow!,5
7656,"Some of the information from video to video was repetitive. However, I learned a lot about how organic food is good for people and the environment. Additionally, it was great to see how children can get involved in the kitchen and i hope that any parents who watch this try to get their children to be involved with a small garden or helping to prepare meals. Hands-on is the best way for kids to learn!",4

The diagrams are cute and engaging.A great course for those who are not used to eating healthy, and do not cook on a regular basis.For those who are already health conscious and enjoy cooking, this course may not provide you with much new information, but rather confirmed what I already knew and was taught as a child by your mother, or through learning how to cook healthy meals for yourself.",4
7670,"This was a great course with a lot of good information. I continue to use a lot of the suggestions that she gives in this course for my own benefit, as well as share with others.

7675,"Thank you for this excellent class. I knew all the intellectual aspects of it already, but the cooking demonstrations changed my life. I now feel like I know how to cook for my child, pack her lunches, shop for food together, grow a home garden and much more.",5
7676,"We don't have children, but I really enjoyed taking this online course on child nutrition and cooking offered by Stanford. Dr. Maya Adam did a very good job with the lecture videos, course content, etc. I just signed up for the Introduction to Food and Health course presented on-demand. You should join me on the journey.",5
7677,"Incredibly informative, definitely appropriate for beginners, but also useful for advanced readers in the field of nutrition, cooking or healthy living in general.

7691,Easy to understand and very interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed this course.,5
7692,"Changed my mind after watching the cooking. The course on nutrition is just ""ok"" but the teacher has a very skewed idea about what ""healthy cooking"" really is and fails to present with reasons for her recipe choices.Anyway I stopped watching the course, again, the nutritional part is fairly good but if you choose to continue the course at least make sure you keep searching for other points of view as well.Best of luck.",2
7693,"Heipful class especially for a working mom. Besides the knowledge, the lecture also demonstrate how to make meal or sweet treats. Very helpful!",5
7694,"This particular curse is an amazing reminder of what we all need from our childhood. My mum always cooked for me, and taught me to feed myself in the best way since I was 5 years old, after leaving home when I was 19 to live the adult life I let the easy fast food rule my life until I was a mother myself and had to go back to the healthy habits.

Usually the video presentations are great, very high quality, my only niggle is that sometimes the black screen PPTs go on for a bit too long, and can be repetitive. Overall a very good course.",4
7699,"This is the best course I've ever did on Coursera (and the only one that I've successfully completed so far!). The instructor is very practical and to the point in her explanations. Each session was very engaging and i appreciate the time taken for her to create the live/animated graphics. This never felt like a boring regular classroom session, most of them were shot in her kitchen, which kept the learner engaged. The tips and the cooking sessions are awesome. I don't have a kid yet, but will surely come back to this course when i have one. Kudos :-)",5
7700,Too basic and too focused on 'farmers market' thinking.,1
7701,It's a very helpful course ...Thank you.,4

7755,It was really helpful and i enjoy it a lot!,5
7756,It was fun doing this course and at the same time was quite informative. The small things matters most is what you realise and long time back Mahatma Gandhi has said most of the things especially the economic and ecological aspects of our food consumption and habits and has predicted the difficulties we would face. JC Kumarappa on Economy of Permanence is a good read in this regard. Excellent presentation and even a kid will watch it with great interest.,4

7763,Very good for parents who do,4
7764,"Good course for beginners, but those with higher levels of nutrition knowledge will likely: 1. Find it way too easy; 2. Find that the recipes actually contain rather unhealthy ingredients (e.g., always avoid butter--too unhealthy); and 3. Find the lack of vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, and other diet-lifestyles discouraging.",3
7765,Maya is great teacher. In this course I liked very much that every video is 3-6 minutes long.Thank you,5
7766,lots of information but in a simple way to understand. i feel like i have learned a lot here and will be trying some of the recipes on my children. Lets hope they are a hit!!,5

7785,"I enjoyed this course very much and found it to be a very good introduction to the science of nutrition and cooking. It wasn't focused on children as much as I thought it would be. I would have liked to know a lot more about portion sizes and calories intake, which weren't much discussed. I knew that some foods were good and others were bad... thanks to the course, I now also know why! I didn't find the course too challenging and thought that Maya Adams was a very pleasant instructor.",4
7786,"I am really disappointed with the content of this course. If what you're looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat, maybe this course is for you. If, however, you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies, toddlers, and young children, or you'd like to know how their needs change over time, this course is not for you. I was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to chew/eat difficult things (ex: whole apples). I wanted to know at what age/weight you switch to 2% milk. I wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time. I wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddler's diet and what, if any, extra vitamins should be added. I wanted tips on weaning if you're still nursing a toddler... I guess I just wanted more.In addition, the quizzes are so easy as to be silly. Actual quiz question and correct answer: Which is NOT a good way to approach grocery shopping if healthy choices are desired? Answer: Visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first. COME ON! Did I need a Stanford University course to tell me that one?!?!?While the instructor is knowledgeable, this course is geared toward someone with NO knowledge, not someone who wants to gain a deeper understanding. The videos are painfully slow (am I waiting for a doodle here???) and I could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos. And the recipes... good god! I don't think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top. If she'd upped the game- showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding, say, chia seeds, different fruits, flax, etc. and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast, that would have been a useful topic.I'm just hugely disappointed. This course is best suited to perhaps a health department; not to someone seeking college level information about a topic that matters to their children's lives.",1

7812,"I'm taking this course just out of curiosity and I'm loving it!There's a lot of information about food, how to understand what you're getting from the markets, how to be healthy in a world full of processed meals... it's pretty interesting!

Kurchakova",5
7868,"This is a great course for new parents who have no background on child nutrition. For those who are already familiar with basic nutrition, most of this course may be a review for you but there's some good information and facts to take away. I wish the instructor had a little more training/skill in the cooking segments (e.g. basic knife skills she said don't cut your finger but held the knife completely wrong, using the knife to point at different ingredients).",3
7869,it's the core information that every parents or even every person should know about food & nutrition. this course has made me cook for our kids and plant our own veggies.,4
7870,"I found this course very much valuable for kids as well as other elder people. The teaching method was highly impressive and Dr. Maya Adam really inspired me. I wanted to give 5 stars but I found few things missing, such as food recipes were without quantity of items (especially in written format), gardening was described in a very short format (I felt that it required little bit more detail), market visits could be a very healthy and informative section, some experts advice & suggestion (including famous chefs), some discussion over food available and prepared in hotels/restaurants & also visits over there. Over all it's really a good course and I would definitely recommend to others. My all the best wishes to Dr. Maya Adam such a great work and hope see more from her.Thank you.Regards,Shoukat Shadat Ali",4

7872,I enjoyed the course and I cooked some of the dishes it is really taste great beside it is healthythank you!,4
7873,"This course reinforced what I know about nutrition and provided a more fundamental basis for the mechanisms at play. With a balance of facts with practical tips, this course avoids a lot of the extremes seen in most discussions on nutrition. Biggest takeaways:* The food that spoils the quickest is the best for us because the nutrients that pests want are the nutrients that we want too. As much as possible, choose unprocessed foods.* While this course is agnostic in terms of vegetarian or carnivorous diets, it suggests that most Americans eat more meat than is healthy for them and the environment.* As much as possible, eat a rainbow. Variety is key to getting a complete variety of the nutrients we need.* Plate size matters a lot* The fresher and more local your produce, the better it is for you and the environment.* Drink water and a lot of it",5
7874,Clear and useful information. It worked really good for me that it was self-paced.,5
7875,Informative and practical. I took this course because of my four year old picky eater. I got some helpful tips to help feed my child with heathy food with simple steps.,5

7883,"This course helped me understand more about the science behind foods. A lot of the content I already knew but it was nice to have a refresher. A lot of the recipes were great ideas (I have already made most of them before being introduced to this course). The videos that involved making the meals were a bit ""dumbed down"" for people who are not used to cooking but I like the cheerful attitude of everybody who came on screen.",5
7884,Great course for beginners!,4
7885,"There's a little bit too much in the way of ""buy organic!"" when there's no evidence to recommend that but other than that a very nice course. I would recommend that they retool it to be more accessible to people on the lower income brackets. I got news for you, ""almond flour"" is not something most people are going to spring for when it costs several times what wheat flour does.",4
7886,"Teacher tells us many useful tips for cooking, which are easy to rememer and to do.",5
7887,"The pace of the course :) and the speed of narration was very good. In deed it makes anyone understand what is being conveyed.

7888,I only took this Course because I was forced too and I don't think it matters what you eat it's just how much you eat. You also don't need to eat lots of Vegetables and Fruit to be a Health person just saying .Plus this course is boring as hell,1

7909,I have no regrets at all in starting and ending this course! It is indeed a great motivation especially for me because I'm a semi-vegetarian and at the same time fond of organic food. I'll be always grateful to this learning experience! :),5
7910,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging course that highlighted some pertinent aspects of child nutrition, which will in turn I believe help your child foster a positive relationship with the food they consume as youngsters into adulthood. Some highly practical cooking techniques were explored and as a new father I feel more confident in the food we buy, prepare and feed our son. A very valuable course.",5
7911,Brilliant!,5
7912,Loved it.,5

7926,Great,5
7927,easy to understand,5
7928,"Education was beneficial to my everyday life. I help but revert back to the lessons taught when it comes to my diet, and the little ones that run around our house.

I would suggest this course to anyone, and though it may seem easy. The diagrams and lessons will stick with you through every meal.",5

7954,I extremely enjoyed the couse. It changed my view of cooking! And I do appreciate the vivid illustrations and useful skills provided in the le,5
7955,I really enjoy how in-depth the lessons are. I have four small children and have learned that they eat and drink what we do because they love to mimic us as their role models and if we would not want a bunch of junk in our bodies why should our children. This world is so fast paced and fast food junkies yet we can still make even small choices that are healthy for us like maybe a grilled chicken or a salad if we absolutely have to have something while out. Otherwise it's much better and cheaper to cook at home and have family time,4

7959,"Very useful nutritional and food information structured with care, combined with common sense advice to apply in every household.The whole package is served with delicate ambient music, practical recipes and kitchen advices, and last but not least, with love towards children and family.One might find inside some controversial aspects as maybe too much frying, cooking in aluminium foil presumed to be bad, using sugar when cooking, but everyone is free to adapt the content to his own perceptions, fears and style. The main philosophy proposed, the moderation, is a keeper though.I just loved taking this course",5

7975,"This course indicated to me how important and irreplaceable is healthy eating during children's growth and development. Also, cooking for your child is a beautiful way to spend time together, express love and stimulate your child to develop good habits.

7976,"I very much enjoyed this course and I learned so much! Very simple, easy to understand, but highly informative and valuable information. I would actually take this course a second time as a refresher because I liked it so much! Instructor was very clear, easy to understand, and pleasant to listen to. Her videos were also relaxed and fun which helped keep me interested.",5
7977,"This was an amazing experience for me. The teaching method was an absolute pleasure for me as a leaner. Great graphics and short lessons worked perfectly for me. It was as if I just didn't want the course to finish. Well I guess what I am trying to say is, I not only learned so much, but I enjoyed the learning process. It was all smooth for me. Keep the strategy up! Many",5
7978,"Clearly state what we should do, why we should do that and provide simple solutions. No hard and confusing terminologies. Also, scenes like families eating at the dinner table is really touching.",5
7979,Love it!!!,5
7980,This course was one of the best that I have seen,5
7981,It was too simple for my taste and not very fullfilling science wise,2
7982,"I liked the course, however it was too basic.",4
7983,Excellent course...really enjoyed learning about healthy eating alternatives for children and how to involve them in the process of cooking. The class got me motivated to practice these great habits with my family. :),5
7984,I loved this class! It taught me a lot and was easy for me to pick up where I left off with my busy schedule. I'm so excited to try these recipes and all that I learned with my family!,5
7985,"Interesting class with great practical tips. The instructor encourages eating only the highest quality food, but is also realistic about what her audience will be able to obtain. The recipes make healthy cooking less intimidating.",5
7986,Really useful as a CPD platform or as a parent wanting to research,5
7987,I love Child Nutrition and Cooking. So educational .,5
7988,"I enjoyed taking this course. I have learned several *new* things about buying, preparing and cooking food. The videos are straight-forward and the content is presented in a clear and concise way.",5
7989,"the lady, her way of talking, her illustrations.. out of the world!",5
7990,A long-time practitioner and a loving mother provides science-based learning about child nutrition. The content was very interactive and accessible. She not only conducts research in this area but also applies it to her daily life.,5
7991,"Excellent Course for me!!Thank you very much Maya! You help me a lot whith all the information, mainly because I've a baby and love to make helthier foods for him!",5
7992,"awsome for my wife , we need it!!!!",5
7993,"I felt like a lot of this information was VERY basic, and then I consider the people around me and how little they know about food and nutrition. Someone like my niece who is young with an infant would definitely benefit from this course. I like the way the information was presented, very easy to comprehend. Overall I'd recommend this course if you are interested in knowing a bit more about nutrition regardless if you have a child.",4
7994,"This was a really good course. The information was useful and down to earth and the Tutor was friendly with her presentation. I recommend this course to lots of people, friends and colleagues.",5
7995,"This was a good introduction to Coursera for me. Some of the information I already knew, but it was good to learn the ""why"" behind some of it. There were a few of the quizzes that contained questions from videos that hadn't been covered yet. Her information about food allergies was good, I would like to see her offer a class on just that topic.",4
7996,Very beneficial. I LIKED IT. Deserves 10 stars indeed.,5
7997,Excellent course. I have learned so many ways to cook healthy food.,5
7998,The recipes shared are simple to follow...,4
7999,this is the course that no one can afford to miss,5
8000,Awesome course!,5
8001,"The modules are rampant with bias against ""big food,"" without considering the science. On the other hand, if you take the course as a whole, then yes, the population would be better off if we all followed the suggestions contained in this course than if we continue on our current path for how we consume food. So the general idea is not without merit. However, I would have expected better from a Stanford faculty member. What is being taught should be just the science, without opinions or biases.",3
8002,I love it that course.It is very interesting for me and I learn a lot of food and nutrition.,5
8003,A good mix of theory and practice!,4
8004,"Very informative, easy to learn, and love the videos! I want my kitchen to look like the professor's!",5

8007,Very interesting course,5
8008,"Very helpful in nutrition, not just for kids, but in general. Made me more aware of some of the processed junk I've been putting in my body",4

8017,"I love this course. It really help me put my family's health into perspective. Months later I still review models and let others, especially moms, know about the course.",5
8018,the course is so great. I learned a much about nutrious diet which i have to feed to my littel sister. As a pedietrician these information i will teatch them to every mother in my clinic. Thanx alot . I appretiate your hard efforts.,5
8019,Great course - I think there could be more on different grain types and alternatives to pasta and potatoes. Also the videos can be speed up during the drawings. Sometimes the sound changes awkwardly during the parts were there is only drawing.,4
8020,"Wonderful, very informative. Thank you for a great experience.",5
8021,very informative and makes eating better exciting.,5
8022,Gave me a better understanding about how food works and the different influences on human health. Really easy to understand content as well.,5

8026,Great course with fabulous teacher. I still want to learn more!,4
8027,I really enjoyed the passe and the visual stimulation. I appreciate that Dr. Maya Adam made the lecture personal by sharing her experiences and including her family in the videos. Thank you and I look forward to completing more courses especially if Dr. Adam is the presenter.,5
8028,Perfect course,5
8029,I really enjoyed this class. The teacher is very upbeat and interesting as well. Lots of good recipe instructional videos. She also breaks nutritional information down until its easily understood. Thanks!,5
8030,Good and clear content. A bit from an American point of view... I missed some in depth explanation (like the class of the nerv-system or the Glycemic index). Overall easy to watch and good lessons.,3
8031,Excellent introduction to child nutrition.,4
8032,"Worst course ever. I stopped partway through. Too many links to outside stuff. Tests/quizes were not based on what was presented in the lessons. Test design is horrible, too many negative questions. Glances over the good true information about nutrition to tell us about free range farms, farmers markets, etc., which most people do not have access to or can not afford.Giving it 1 star is being nicePeople who sponsored it should get their money back.",1
8033,"Interesting and informative. Contained a wealth of very useful knowledge about Brain Science, and it was delivered in a quiet, calm, and clear fashion. Simply excellent. Nicely done !!",5
8034,Its Awesome,5
8035,"Good science, great explanations, simple recipes with tips and advice. Strongly recommended to people with little/no cooking and/or science backgrounds - especially new university students and parents. However, I would not consider the professor (she is a doctor though) a skilled chef - while her recipes are great and simple, the techniques she uses are perhaps not the best, given that she is conducting a course that's nearly 20% cooking demonstrations. I would strongly suggest consulting a Jamie Oliver book/video, or Michael Smith to augment this course.TL'DR: Great science and explanations, good recipes, could have used better cooking techniques. Good for uni students/healthy eaters.",4
8036,Simple and useful information about nutrition. Very interesting!,5
8037,Course is clearly and included lots of information.I am clincal dietetician so I can confirm that all of information are true.The teacher are prepared and watching her was my pleasure.I am recommend that course.,5
8038,The tips and principles are quite useful even for a different cultural background. I recommended this course to a friend who just had her baby back then.,5
8039,"Very very interesting, and practical in home cooking for working mothers, , give important tips of nutrition about mixing food o all types, speaking of technical issues, video is very good quality, the teacher is clear, and production is very attractive and well created.",5
8040,"The course is very helpful not only for Child Nutrition, but Personal Nutrition as well. The course content was very interesting and easy to follow.",5
8041,Exсellent course for mothers.,5
8042,Interesting and informative!,5
8043,amazing course.I really enjoyed listening to all information. Every day I try to cook something from recipes given. My 2 year old son loves them!!!Thanks,5

8046,A little too basic but it was a good class. Thanks!,4
8047,I found it very basic. There were lots of repetition. I was expecting something more in-depth. Loved the graphics though.,2
8048,This is an excellent course for parents! You can learn many simply tips that will have a profound impact on the way you cook for your family. Cooking healthy food doesn't need to be more expensive or more complicated that not so healthy options. Very recommendable! Maya is a great host.,5
8049,Very interesting and pleasant to follow.,5
8050,Loved this course!,5
8051,The course has completely changed my approach in cooking food for my kids and family. Kids are much more satisfied after each food and they don't reach out for junk food. Thanks for giving valuable information about food and this is going to stay with me for rest of my life.,5
8052,very good to be in healthier side after watching 1 week course.,5
8053,"Excellent course. The material presented was not difficult to comprehend. I highly recommend this to parents who are in a quandry every night when the question, ""what's for dinner?"" presents itself. More than the content, I was most impressed by the manner in which the course was taught. Instead of a ""talking head"" format, the instructor used a variety of techniques to present the material, including teaching the majority of the class from her kitchen, using an interactive ""blackboard"" to illustrate concepts while she spoke and lots of cooking demonstrations. Kudos to Stanford for producing such high quality content. I have started a lot of Coursera courses and this is the first one that I've been able to complete because the content kept me engaged.",5
8054,Fun and informative.,5
8055,It was fantastic! I loved every minute of it!!!!!!,5
8056,Fun course. I learned a lot about nutrition and got quite a few easy healthy recipes. This course actually inspired me to cook for my family.I'm hoping there's a second part that will come out in the future.,5
8057,is very useful and interesting,4
8058,"It is the first time I can hear directly about the importance of 'child nutrition' in every day life setting.

The recipes that were given - I use on a weekly basis. The notes I took from the course - I look over often to refresh my memory. I highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn about a healthy lifestyle that then can be passed on to children.",5
8083,am doing diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care. This course has helped me lot about providing healthy and safe food for children!,5
8084,"I love this course ! It teaches you what can be in your child's food, drinks, what they should have on a regular basis and the kind of routine that you should set up for them so they can get used to eating healthy foods instead of fatty, greasy foods from fast food places. I would recommend anyone who is thinking about working with children in their career to take this course. It really will help you and your family with eating healthy every day.",5
8085,great course concise and percisethank you for everything:),5
8086,I loved this course ! Thank you !,5
8087,"I think this course should be required for anyone who wants a healthy family. The instructor is amazing, not only is she charismatic, but very knowledgeable and caring. The information in the course is presented in away that is easy to comprehend and apply in life. There's not much more I can say besides - I'm happy I took this course, I'm happy it's been offered to me and my family is a happier family with this information I've learned",5

8091,Super presentation and very good information,5
8092,Thanks!,5
8093,It is very useful,5
8094,"this course is very useful if you want to learn about something that majority of people(not including me) don't care about, and is based on out-dated info and opinions of a high middle class, house mom. this course is a waste of data. someone get some actual statistics here.",3
8095,"It is a good course to general people and even to who have some specialization, to relax and practise English if it is necessary.",5
8096,Thanks very muchIwish i can take a certificate for this course.,5
8097,Great and absolutely well done,5
8098,"Super clear, short & fun introduction to nutrition",5
8099,I really love this course!,5
8100,"Informative without being preachy. Cute, entertaining drawings.",4
8101,"This is a course that shows, in a practical and funny way, fundamental nutrition concepts. I recommend to take it even if you do not have children, but you are interested into understand how our bodies processes food and how eating healthy could be easier than you ever imagined.",5
8102,loved it learned lots of new things and my family is eating healthier everyday,5
8103,I love the cooking demonstration most and the easy-to-understand explanation really helps me a lot to prepare my Food.,5
8104,"I loved almost every episode of this course. They are very different: some are practical, some are very informative and all of them are easy to get. The course is simple and i would say basic especially for those who have decided to change food behavior, but does not know where to start.",5
8105,Nicely organised and content rich course; helps to know a lot about child nutrition.,4
8106,"This course was a great refresher for basic nutritional/health information, and comes with a really great message: don't worry if you're not a great ""chef"", basically any home-cooked meal will be healthier than fast or processed food! I enjoyed the cooking demonstrations and simple solutions for making healthy choices.",4
8107,I enjoyed the course.,5
8108,Nicely done!,5
8109,"Very good. Nice choice of person to teach this course Her knowledge and soothing voice and occasional cameos of her kids made this very easy to absorb, relate and want to learn more. My next shopping trip to the store was 90% more healthier than before. I made better decisions about what I want to feed my family....especially my 2 year old granddaughter that pretty much loves all veggies and fruit. Great time to influence her eating habits.",5
8110,"Very interesting and handy. I'm Spaniard, so most of the things are basic for me such as the use of onion and garlic in meals, and the use of street market for shopping vegetables. But the recipes were fantastic and since I'm a mother of a 1-year-old child, I will put on practice soon. Thank you!",4
8111,"I have loved this course. It is the perfect mix between nutrition, recipes and usefull tips for a better eating. I am so happy and I have learned a lot!",5
8112,Very useful and easy ! I just love Maya!,5
8113,maya adams class is very informative,5
8114,Great information to use in my classroom as well as with my son at home!!,5
8115,"As a college student I really appreciate how many of the tips shared are simple and can be implemented on a day to day basis. A lot the recipes and ideas shared do not require really fancy equipment or ingredients I've never heard of, are super expensive, or hard to find. The instructor truly cares about students leaning how to cook for themselves and eat healthier and provides information to do so without judgement. Her passion is clear and I love how she promotes little steps and not some drastic change that can eat up all of your energy and focus to implement. Thank you!!!!",4
8116,Really good!! I enjoyed a lot!! ;),5
8117,great course and great teacher :D,5
8118,fantastic and informative course and good for the health,5
8119,"Good Lessons and solid ideas for all ages, all income levels. Good Job.",5
8120,its pretty good,5
8121,"I enjoyed the mix of videos, demos and visually-oriented lectures. I learn best when I can see little drawings with main points, so that style of illustration was perfect for me. I appreciated the human touch as well, being able to see the instructor at home in her own kitchen, with her own children. Thank you!",5
8122,I would like to recive a certificated,5
8123,I really learned a lot. My baby is still 4 months old and I'm practicing to eat and cook healthily. I started reading labels and researching healthy alternatives of food. The way the information was presented was simple yet elegant. I'm hoping this course will have more lessons. I really enjoyed the current lessons.,5
8124,A very educating course.,5
8125,Informative and helpful!,5
8126,On demand format was great for a stay home mum and all the cooking tips were very useful.,5
8127,"This course is great!! And fun too...I learn many thing that I've overlooked for these years, just like nutrition label and soon. This course tell me the basic knowledge of healthy meal and the importance of making my own meal. Unfortunately, this course is pretty much short like the other...It'll be SUPER if the content of the course could be extended a lil' bit (or a lot more is better though :p)",4
8128,The best course I have ever had the opportunity to participate in.,5
8129,I enjoyed the course. I would like a course that teaches the next step in Nutrition.,5
8130,"I love it, i learn a lot. Im now using the tips she gave to give my little baby the best food i can make. Thanks a lot for this course",5
8131,"Couple things I didn't agree with, but for the audience in mind I think it's very solid and has a wonderful introduction to child nutrition or just to grasp nutrition in general.",4
8132,Very helpful tips!!!,4
8133,"This is what I was looking for! I found it very thorough, easy to understand and very practical course. Very grateful to the coursera and Dr Maya Adam for this wonderful course! :)",5
8134,Every mother should do this course .,5
8135,"Thanks for all the advices, It was great to learn how to cook healthy.",5
8136,"Well,I learnt a lot not only in cooking meal,but also in getting nutrition in healthy way.",4
8137,"I enjoyed this course very much. This has helped me understanding many basic things about food and what is important for my kids. There are many little helpful tips. As a working mother with 2 little kids, it's so much better to have seen these videos of ""simple cooking"", than watching cook shows in TV that make cooking so complicated (by learning nothing) and tiring. Thanks for this great course and your effort in improving the health of kids of the world! Best regards, Huiyan Roy, a Chinese German mother",5
8138,"Really informative, if every parent had taken this course before having children the world would be healthier. Also a great class for adult nutrition as well! Thanks for including recipes, I would love some more cooking demonstrations!",5
8139,Good One!!,4
8140,A very good course and so apetizing !,5
8141,"I really enjoy the food preparation and the important facts about our body, about our food intake habits. thank u a lot Maya.",3
8142,I am a professional Chef and was really helpful for me to get some new view about cooking and using ingredients more careful.,4
8143,The structure and the material taught in this course is excellent. The instructer is a very good teacher.,5
8144,"I totally recommend this course, it's didactic, fun and very useful. Even though it's plan for 5 weeks, I get in whenever I can. It's really motivating to change your habits for good.",5
8145,"very interesting and helpful,,,,,,,easy to learn,,,babies are so cute",5
8146,"I like how everything was clearly explained; besides, I think the teacher focuses on things (such as having a own garden or cooking one's chicken breast) which are really useful because they are affordable and they are easy to get used to. She doesn't talk about radical targets which are difficult to follow but quite common sense ones.",5
8147,I found the experience on the course totally enjoyable. It gave me the opportunity to develop my passion for learning about preparing healthy meals and organizing my kitchen in a relaxed way without any pressures.,5
8148,I found it very accessible. I am a student in Nutrition and this course allowed me to understand other areas that my current course does not provide. Thanks!,5
8149,good course,3
8150,This is a fantastic course!,5
8151,"Good overall course, basic and got me interested in cooking again!",3
8152,"Condescending, not backed up with evidence and preachy. Somewhere in there are some good ideas for making healthy food for kids but given I'm probably of similar politics to what they're pushing and I found it obnoxious I think they're alienating a lot of people. Must do better.",2
8153,"Very useful course! Take part of it weather you have children or not, beacuse all of us need a reminder about healty living!",5
8154,This course has really good information. Very simple and straightforward and I am happy to say that I am using lots of the tips and ideas with my boys. I did find that some of the tips given were a bit unrealistic however it still makes you want to make better choices about food and your family.,5
8155,Great Class! Wish that the quizzes were more difficult -- they were very straight forward and common sense. The cooking videos inspired me to cook with more variety in my own meals.,5
8156,Great course,5
8157,Good for everyone,4
8158,"it's a very great course, if you want to learn some basic knowledge about nutrition and how to cook a balanced diet for your children, this is the best course you can get.",5
8159,Very interesting course. It has a lot of potential to develop interest among those who aren't really fascinated with cooking. Looking forward to many more courses by Dr.Maya Adams.,5
8160,Great course! I wish there was a statement of accomplishment available when I complete it.,5
8161,clear and easy for me to learn the cooking,4
8162,"Nice course about eating suggestions and good recipesIt could be useful giving details on how making a diet for children, with information about calories they need and so on",3
8163,I feel very happy to receive this course. Thank all of you to give us such a great opportunity.,5
8164,This is a very friendly course. It is complete and easy to follow. I highly recommend it.,5
8165,Really good video lectures! Pedagogical and with many interesting examples. Could have been a bit more of the statistical stuff in som form of interactive exercises.. Perfect for a first grasp on the field of human behavioral genetics!,4
8166,Highly recommended. I loved the structure - I could watch a lecture every morning on my commute and do a bit of reading over my lunchtime. Matt McGue was a great lecturer who broke down complicated topics into easy to understand chunks. I'm a Psychology beginner but I got a lot out of this course and most of all I really enjoyed it. Definitely give it a go!,5
8167,This was a superb course. Very accessible for the non-specialist. Matt McGue is an excellent lecturer and very clear and conscientious about his subject. I feel I have a stronger grounding in behavioural genetics and am using much of the research in the classroom today. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the influence of genetics on behaviour.,5
8168,Amazing... Thank you for beeing so pationate by the topic and keeping such complicating information so simple and clear.,5
8169,"Totally awesome! Great content, great techer, all videos are very well organized and well-thought. There is no need to have any previal knowledge in genetics nor psicology, it is meant for anyone who wants to look at the world and people differently!",5
8170,"""much better than the data science with R concentration provided also by John Hopkins. This course has concrete examples, and the lecturer doesn't treat his audience like the first-grade kids."" I take this back. The lecturer doesn't know what he's taking about and what he is gonna talk about for at least half of the time.",1
8171,"Thankful that a course like this exists, as most MOOCs are quite basic. And thanks to Coursera for running the courses even though attendance seems to be low (darn, that pesky calculus pre-requisite). Lecture quality is varied--some quite good (such as the lectures in Boot Camp I) and others seem like he hadn't looked at his notes for a long time. It's great to hear a stats professor talk about the strengths and weaknesses of many approaches. It complements a mathematical statistics book quite well. It would have been nice to have had some problems that were more challenging. Overall, while the Johns Hopkins Data Science MOOCs are pretty good, they are a bit more basic than what's available through MIT and Stanford.",4
8172,It was very challenging. It would be better if a couple of practice exercises were put after the relevant lecture videos and not just after the weekly lecture videos.,3
8173,"This course should be part of the Data Science specialization. Actually, you can supplement the Statistical Inference course with these two Boot camp courses really well!A great revision of statistics, very rigorous and thorough cover of all distributions and hypothesis tests.",5
8174,"The concepts are good but the delivery is quite dry. Very hard to pass the quizes, as there are no analogies or examples in the videos - just theory. I did not enjoy this course as much as I did the first two in the programme.",2
8175,Great course,5
8176,"This course was a complete joke. Many practice quiz questions and even test questions had wrong answers marked as right so you had to re-write test over and over until you guessed which one of the wrong answers was right. Also, there was a theme of lazily worded questions and answers throughout the entire course. There is always a way to write in non ambiguous ways, it just takes some effort. Very frustrating to decipher the lazily worded questions. Someone should have proof read this course. I feel like an idiot for paying for it.",1
8177,Thank you very much. It was very useful course and lecturers provided very insightful information. I look forward to participate at your next course. All the best.,5

8196,"Very efficient course, now I can feel change in my communication.",5
8197,"I liked the course very much. All the lessons are interesting and informative, the group discussions give opportunity to know the point of view of other students",5
8198,"It is hard to be constructive when you do have something brilliant to compare with.The very first thing to say is that the course is presented through poorly drawn cartoons for 5-year-olds and ineffective lecture videos with little or no eye contact with the instructors. The presentations are filled with strange icons and drawings appearing every here and there, making not much of a professional impression.After watching videos, in just about 5 minutes after the lecture is over, the retained information was always going to zero. Sometimes I had to rewind the video to retrieve the points they were trying to make. Or maybe I just didn't want to listen to them. But it seems impossible due to the fact I am interested, and I do finish every course on Business writing I run into. Always with 100% final grade.The overall demeanor is not as professional as it has to be. I recommend the designers to watch ""Write Professional Emails"" with Gerry Landers by Georgia Tech and ""Teach English Now!"" with Dr. Shane Dixon by Arizona State University. I do not normally remember the instructors' names, except for brilliant ones. I do not remember the ones of this course.I do hope my criticism will eventually lead to a better experience for your students. I apologize if I was overly direct and wordy.Regards,Rafael",1

8256,Very well formulated with all the necessary details required to understand the basics,5
8257,"Overall a good introduction to Big Data. Needed no prior experience, but ironically I found I'd misunderstood the way Map:Reduce worked. Reading around afterwards I worked out exactly how it worked, but I didn't think it was explained very well. Overall though, a great intro into a subject which is highly hyped in the IT industry, and demystifies some of the concepts, explaining what Big Data is good for, and hinting at it's limitations.",4
8258,"Very helpful overview of all major topics around big data. Engaging, never boring. A couple of good framework to structure the various information around the topic",5
8259,Very cool the course!!!!,5

8305,Perfect introduction course to Big Data,5
8306,Excellent introductory course. Will continue to complete more courses in this specialization.,5
8307,Quite shallow...,3
8308,"Good INTRODUCTION , an understanding of data management will help digest alot of it. But very simple and elegant course with only simple concepts to grasp which in reality covers big data pretty well! Excited to take the rest of the courses",4
8309,"Overall, a good overview for Hadoop, Mapreduce and big data concepts",5
8310,Best for basic,5

8330,a very good learning experience. really enjoyed it. thank u for this course especially to the instructors.,5
8331,I did this course and have been enjoying all of the subsequent courses. I find the content great and the examples and lecture fascinating. I have been working with Cloud computing for 5 years. This course really opened my eyes up on the applicability and the inner workings. It is not a programmers course. It is excellent if you are a Sr. manager or strategist that needs to work with people as part of a data science team. I think this should be a mandatory course for anyone who thinks they may need to deal with bid data and the new computing cloud universe,5
8332,"This topic is new for me, therefore some of the topics required supplemental explanations to fully understand.",4
8333,It is very useful. The professors are paced and explain so well.,5
8334,"Very informative and interesting. Instructors presented information well, and it was well organized.",5
8335,Course is good to get initial background of Big Data and to understand What/Why Big Data.,4
8336,"The first week or so feels inconsistent and oversimplified. After that, when you get into the actual content, it gets much better. It then ends on a peer-graded assignment. While the assignment itself is creative and fun to complete, I've never been a fan of peer-graded assignments so early in an introductory course load.",3
8337,The Big Data Analysis is one of the emerging topic. The course provides the detailed information about various concepts that can be easily understood by learners. Thanks to the faculty members who are handling the course.,5

8339,Very useful Big Data introduction,5
8340,Great course!! Excellent for beginners!!,5
8341,"I learnt basic of Big Data, exicited to dive deeper.Very informative and engaging",4
8342,this course need some odifications because of cloudera version,3
8343,Great introduction course. The pace is slow enough that a person without technical background should be able to follow it. However as you are not restricted to only do the current week task its also great for someone who had some experience.,4
8344,very good introduction.,4
8345,it was very educative and it opened my mind to this new world,5
8346,"Too many concepts, better to provide more interactive questions during the video and more examples to demonstrate the concept.If possible, make the assignment submission free.",4
8347,I'm not sure who the target audience is for this course. The level of presentation seems rudimentary to me. I had a hard time sustaining interest in the course and did not finish.,3
8348,Comprehensive introduction to Big Data and Hadoop. Great and simple explanation of MapReduce.,5
8349,"I little slow to start but the pace picks up nicely. Content is generally easy to follow. Some differences between spoken and voice recognition subtitled text. Practical tests were interesting but not particularly well explained for the MapReduce shapes task, which seemed to leave a few puzzled.",3
8350,Some commands need small modifications,5
8351,I cannot complete the course due to installations problem of the software required even if I have all the requirements needed on my laptop.,1
8352,"It covers theoretical part of ""What big data is"" and basic info about Hadoop. Quality of presentation slides is below average. Most of them are not readable - many fonts, many colors, some with complicated pictures, some with no information at all. Part with Map reduce is just slightly touched, not explained in details, without examples. Practical tasks from hadoop are very easy and they show nothing (just how to navigate over hadoop file system.",2
8353,It would be good if more explanation and more examples are demonstrated.,3
8354,Great Course! Gives lots of insight into big data1,5
8355,Excellent course for beginners!!!,5
8356,Very good introduction to Big Data.,5

8358,thanks for instructors this course helped me to understand what exactly bib data modules,5
8359,Excellent introduction to Big Data and Hadoop. Practical exercise reinforces materials.,4
8360,The classes could have been delivered by creating more interest.,3
8361,"This is a great introduction to the concepts of Big Data. Compared to whats available online, this course does a great job of digging into the components and definition of big data vs just diving in with code examples. Well worth it for anyone trying to get a holistic understanding of big data.",4
8362,good introduction but it's a little bit expensive.,4
8363,Great starting point if you want to understand Big Data ecosystem and basic concepts,5
8364,Perfect!,5
8365,"Very good introduction to the field. Not too complex, so a good starting point.",4
8366,"Nice and pleasant course, gives the basics and it is accessible to everyone.",5
8367,Basic info covered.,3
8368,I learnt many things about Big Data. Now at least I have some basic foundation in it.,5
8369,The time / usefulness rate of this course is very low. Most of the stuff they teach (at least in introduction) is very basic theory that's presented in not really interesting way.,3
8370,Excellent introduction into big data. Material is well organized and well presented for anyone that is not familiar with big data,5
8371,Great introductory course to big data!,5
8372,"Very complete as an Introduction, the tutors have deep knowledge of the subject and it has even a practical session. Indeed is a valuable source.",5
8373,"The course was awesome. It taught me the ins and outs of Big Data. Although its only the basics, I'd still recommend it to everyone before deciding whether you want to keep going as a Big Data specialist or not.Some steps are not uptodate e.g. hadoop and wordcount aren't in the same folder as listed by this course. They were in the other folder /usr/lib... . It'd be nice if you guys put a ""find"" command with that description, because I've had to search it myself. That's why I took one star out of it.",4
8374,Excellent course. Very good foundation.,5
8375,An excellent early approach to a big data implementation,5
8376,"It is a fantastic course for beginners. The modules and the teachers are very clear, and the content is so good.After this course, I can say I know something about Big Data, no idea before do this course. The examples and the Virtual Machine was so helpful to understand how hadoop works.Thanks a lot... a fantastic course... thanks true.",5
8377,"I really like, it is flexible. well structured.",5
8378,Thank you all.,5
8379,"In this course, I learned how to use Hadoop basically. With the clear explanation of the Professor, I believe every one can realize in a short time.",4
8380,very boring,2
8381,"It's amazing , gained knowledge about What is Big Data, its sources and much more.",5
8382,Learn alot in Big Data,5
8383,Quite poor. Just a lot of talk and nothing practical.,2
8384,Excellent teaching method of teaching with short informative videos :),5
8385,Dr Altintas is an excellent presenter and very thorough. I would have enjoyed more practical exercises instead of mainly theory videos. The ones done with Hadoop in the last week were very enjoyable. I also enjoyed Dr Gupta's videos as well. Excellent intro to Big Data.,4
8386,This course is very informative to enhance my carrier in right way of my own choice.,5
8387,Kindler Gentler introduction to Big Data Concepts and Hadoop hands on exercise was great!,5
8388,Good introduction to Big Data and Hadoop,5
8389,it's too much basic stuffs.,3
8390,Awesome course with very dynamic exercises,5
8391,There should be some reading material to assist learning. The course was too expensive for the small content it provided,3
8392,"The course was very useful with what knowledge it provides. However, it would be better if there were more hands-on exercises on relevant stuff. The exercises are too easy and boring. Tougher exercises should be added and more time should be spent on the Hadoop Ecosystem part. Knowing the history helps but it should not replace more important topics.",3
8393,"""Dhaado sutho mukhe dhaado wanton"" ( Sindhi)Very nice indeed i liked it very much",5
8394,Really good course. I had the opportunity to learn about the fundamentals of Big Data. Now I want to take the following courses. :),5
8395,Excellent!!!New knowledge,5

8416,"A good introduction to big data (last time I was working with it was in the 1990s when a few 10s of MB was a huge dataset!). Slightly let down by the forums, despite loads of mentors there seems to be almost no presence of the teaching staff beyond setting up a few posts to spark discussion which in reality just prompt short responses and no replies.",3
8417,More practical use cases and applied knowledge base need to be included,4
8418,It was a Good course to start with the Big Data. The content is also good and properly arranged. Good Instructors. I will suggest this course as a starter for Big Data.,4
8419,That was fun!!!,5
8420,Last exercise is half the course and took many frustrating hours to install and for me never worked. No support provided by instructors. You are on your own.,1
8421,Good introduction to big data. I would prefer that the hadoop lesson have more practical exercices;,3

8426,A very informative course to kick start on Big Data and Hadoop concepts.,5
8427,"Too many things I already know and which are quite obvious, when you have some little computer science knowledge, less practical information; the explanations for installing Cloudera etc are insufficient!!!",1
8428,great so far.,4
8429,This course is perfect for Big Data beginers. I loved how they explained haoop's architecture and big data principles in a simple way.,5

8431,Very nice introduction to the core concepts of big data. Gradually introduced you to the concepts,4
8432,Very good. It was challenging.,5
8433,Concept organization and presentation astute and informative. Thanks!,5
8434,Very basic info.,4
8435,"Great introduction, very detailed and aligned with my expectations.Thanks!",5
8436,"If you're unfamiliar with how big data is processed and what makes it unique from ""regular"" data, this is a good introductory course. It provides sufficient detail to understand the key concepts, programs, and methodologies around Big Data.",4
8437,Very good course for introduction to big data,4
8438,Very very introductory course.,4
8439,"this course provides with a very good Introduction to Big data, concepts are clear and the detail provided is a good start point to continue learning about it",5
8440,This course will go through all the definitions and the core concepts of Big Data.It is a great introductory course.Thank you so much.,5
8441,Really amazing course,5
8442,"Very good course, excellent professors. No myths, reality of big data.",5
8443,"Language is not good, and Lack of Info",1
8444,"The course material is overall very good and easy to understand, although a bit abstract at certain points (mostly when it comes to technical things like what MapReduce consists of and what Programming Models are). Regardless, the instructors do a great job of explaining the concepts. Great course overall",4
8445,"Honestly, for the price paid, the value given is quite low. I expected to have more hands-on working with the Hadoop ecosystem rather than this course's focus on background that really does not help one to become productive.",1
8446,Excellent learning from this.,5
8447,"First two weeks are too much theory , but i guess that is needed for clear understanding of an awesome week 3.",4
8448,It is a great introduction to big data world,5
8449,"Great, very simple intro!",5
8450,Perfect course. Great material and teachers.,5
8451,"The course provided almost no value , and there was almost nothing covered that you couldn't find online for free. The presentation was probably the worst part of the course: It was extremely boring and made it hard to get through the videos.I didn't expect much practical parts in the course, but there was even less than what I expected: What was described as setting up a hadoop cluster consisted of downloading a preconfigured VM image and running it, and then typing in a couple of commands that were provided to you. Again, nothing of value was added, and quickly going over the FAQ page of any of the products mentioned would be more helpful, faster and a lot more interesting.",1
8452,This course is amazing. Excellent Introduction to Big Data!,5
8453,"It is very easy to follow the course. This first course is not complex. As the title says, it is more of an introduction of the world of big data and hadoop. Also, you will learn how to install and run hadoop as well as some very basic functions of MapReduce.Overall a very good course. As a tip, if you are fluent in english, I would recommend you to run the video x1.5 or x1.75. At the beginning it may be hard, but it will reduce the time that you spend watching video.",5
8454,"I would like to enroll many such courses . Excellent Teaching . Thanks to teachers who spent their precious time in preparing slides and delivering quality teaching.. Hats off to Coursera. I recommend my friends too , to enroll such a wonderful course.",5
8455,"Map Reduce hands-on assignment does not have very clear instructions, should be improved for future sessions.",4
8456,"A little bit too conceptual and very basic. Hadoop hands on and HDFS should be much more intensive. However, good material, well presented and explained.",3
8457,A great introduction,4
8458,Less useful than reading an introductory chapter. Being able to reiterate acronyms or idiosyncratic mnemonics does not demonstrate any real understanding of this field. The minimal information provided and low level of the instruction at least clarified that this specialization is not worth pursuing.,1
8459,"Very disappointing. Poorly written quizes and presentations. The level of the course is far too basic to be of value, but is required for the specialization. Why not offer an option to test out of basic introduction courses?",1
8460,"Content is very interesting, nice introduction to Big Data.Slides can be improved though.",4
8461,Good course,5
8462,"Completely Worth it , best mentors , Guides .Awesome Explanation .",5
8463,"Very good course as an introduction to Big Data, It will give you all the needed info to get around and understand what is Big Data and what is HadoopI highly recommend this course for the people who want to have information on Big Data",5
8464,Wonderful introduction to Big Data concepts and well prepared material!!!,5
8465,Too philosophical.,2
8466,"Engaging and challenging, this course was an excellent introduction to Big Data!",4
8467,Great introductionClear and consice.,5
8468,Course is really well explained.,5
8469,"It's a good introduction, but more optional hadoop exercises can be added.",3
8470,"I'd recommend this course be taken as audit. Doesn't add specific value to your skill set! But, it's good to know :-)",3
8471,An introductory course that seems like it should have been the first week of a more in-depth course instead of being a stand-alone course. The cost vs benefit of this particular course is questionable.,3
8472,Good for starters. But could have been more practical than theoretical.,4
8473,I found the course is detailed and explained nicely to start as a beginner. The quiz helps to understand and learned the subject matter properly.,5
8474,"If you're new and an aspirant to the Big Data field, This Course is for you!",5
8475,Thanks to this course I learned the basics of Big Data and looking forward to take the other courses.,5
8476,Good introductory course. The first lessons are slow so I recommend watching them on 2x speed. The last lesson (hands on) is better because it gives a real taste of hadoop,5
8477,Good introduction course for Big Data.,5
8478,"The content of the course is alright and up to date. The instructors are also good, passionate and has a great knowledge.What brings everything down is the video editing and the slide design/quality. They are terrible and clearly not in the field of profession of the creators.All in all, it is an average course, but I can recommend it to anyone interesting in the topic, because it does its job. If someone could improve the slides and the video editing could reach the youtube video reviewer/critic level, it could easily do a 4 out of 5.",3
8479,Great introduction to Big Data concepts and MapReduce,4
8480,"Most of the course is providing useless statistics, i didn't enjoy it and it's a really basic course.",2
8481,Great to Learn.,5
8482,"This is a great introduction for Big Data. It helps me to revisit what I learned from the meetups and webinars, then put the fundamental knowledge and information in a solid foundation. Thank you.",5
8483,Overall a good introduction course to Big Data. It could have been more condensed and contain more programming exercises.,4
8484,"I believe this course can be performed much faster, beware that it is really an introduction, and IT professionals persons may feel it slow, in addition the presenter speaks English very slowly, good for non English proficient persons, but bad for the others.",3
8485,Course was good. I had issue to configure virtual machine . but it worked now .,4
8486,"The material OK, but some of the exercises and their interfaces are not well designed.",4
8487,"Despite my busy work schedule I had fun taking this course especially because of the forum that diverse learners from all around the globe participated it. Twice I got stuck with running hadoop and other learners had posted the solution so I tried their suggestions and I got unstuck! I appreciate those who put in extra work to make my learning easier and fun. Honestly, that was the incentive that made me to complete this course for I was about to drop out. Thank you.",5
8488,"Very basic. All this information of this course can be self taught by Googling and the hands on exercise at the end of the course is a joke. For the $59 price of the course, expected more.",1
8489,"The beginning is a bit theoretical, only the end brings some practical examples up. Slides are a bit old fashioned and presenters are a bit rigid",4
8490,I wish to thank you for such a fantastic course to introduce to the exciting world of Big Data. The concepts were explained beautifully with relevant examples. A special thank you note for Prof Altintas and Prof Gupta for making this so simple.Looking forward to the next set of courses to explore Big Data in detail.,5
8491,very good for beginner easy and give you the bigger picture,5
8492,The course is ok but I found that there were some technical quirks that could be ironed out first. Example is to download the text files in the final assignment the command wget is invaluable. How to leave safe mode if the Name node is in safe mode. VirtualBox is default to 32 bit/ubuntu when the image is 64 bit/Centos/Redhat.In addition the course content is a bit little. It says 3 weeks but I finish it in 2 days. Perhaps it is about quality and not quantity.,3
8493,"It is the best course for getting the overview of Big Data. It builds the basic concepts of data very easily.Thanks to Coursera and University of California, San Diego.",5
8494,Really nice overview about Big Data .. I guess you have to watch it 2 times for better understanding.,5
8495,Good introduction.,5
8496,"The content is better than the last course, nice job !",5
8497,"The course was in he sense truly introduction to Big data Domain and discusses the origin and reason Big Data technologies are required.The only improvement, I would like to suggest is raise the difficulty level of quiz,so that they motivate student to review and understand the key points discussed during tutorial.",5
8498,That is great!,5
8499,This course really usefull for me.,5
8500,"The course is very well made, with very clear concepts and therefore very useful to start in the world of Big Data. Recommended for anyone who wants to have a basic knowledge about Big Data.",4
8501,The whole course is so informative. I'm so glad that I have learnt a lot!,5
8502,"Extremely basic intro, not valuable if you have any understanding of the the space",1
8503,"excellent course, very easy to understand,Hats off to Madam Ilkay Altintas and Sir Amarnath Gupta for explaining the big data concepts in such a simple way .",5
8504,Very informative,5
8505,"I liked it, a lot of concepts for who is begining in the big data :)",5
8506,Good work! Thanks for educating,4
8507,Basic and easy clarification of big data.,4
8508,This is absolutely a hands on experience.,5
8509,A perfect beginner's introduction course to the Big Data World.,5
8510,Introductory Level Course.Nothing much on analytical methods.,3
8511,I feel that the course helped me a lot in understanding what Big Data actually means and gave me an idea of how it's being handled. Well structured and explained.,5
8512,Very informative but the structure is a lecture where the concepts are basically read from a paragraph. Perhaps I'd give more stars if I only saw diagrams.,3
8513,"Loved every second of it, easy to understand, well structured, more big data usage examples in video formats would be a nice addition",4
8514,better the second time around.,5
8515,"Really good course. But, I was unable to complete the final week as I had a lot of trouble installing the Cloudera platform for Hadoop. So, I would recommend others to get that installed well in advance or else if you wait till the last week you might not be able to finish it in time and 6 weeks of effort would go to waste like it did for me.",5
8516,I love this course its worth for a basic and freshers learningThanks Coursera for this...,5
8517,"For an introduction class in Big Data this is excellent: concepts down to the point; good example analogies used; material provided to reinforce concepts and knowledge (transcripts, slides) were great. Videos were pretty good. Content of lessons are good; lab and software downloading/exercise with Hadoop give you a good sense of what expected in more advance classes.I would add a bit more of information regarding to the downloading software and its purposes for those with no computing background (like what OS used when running the Hadoop... maybe I missed that?).The class worth the money paid.",4
8518,"Good Intro course.for Cloudera VM installation to practice Hadoop session, be ready with at least an i5 PC with 8GB RAM",4
8519,I am very thankful to you guyss,5
8520,I enjoyed this course and happily displayed the Certificate on my LinkedIn page!,5
8521,Great course with great instructors,4
8522,It was nice n great experience.,5
8523,"This course allow me to become familiar with Big Data terminology and concepts, big data platforms and related applications. o believe this course this is the fastest way to get into the BIg dATA WORLD.",5
8524,Nice course for a starter.,4
8525,"I learned some new things because I'm a total beginner,I think the contents are updated but not very structured,the hands-on part is just a small peek of the whole big data process system and not very useful.It's not a complete course if you don't take the later courses of the whole specialization.So I gave 4 stars for this introduction course.",4
8526,I really enjoyed the course Big Data !!! excellent!!! I will continue showing it to everyone at the university.Gratitude!!!Thank you!!!,5
8527,Excellent for a introduction course. More exercises would be nice.,4
8528,This course is a good way to begin by the Data science world. I like so much the excercises with Hadoop.,5
8529,"The content of the course is ok. The main problem is that the way the information is presented. Ilkay Altintas, who is the main lecturer, is a sweet woman, but lecturing from a manuscript is not her strongest side. It is clear that she is reading from a screen while she is looking into the camera. Anyone could do that job, and they should have chosen more of an ""news anchor"" type of person with better pronunciation and more flow. It's simply very uninspiring and boring to listen to. Also, 59 dollars is far too expensive for such a short course.",2
8530,This course gave us very clear instruction what the basic ideas are about big data and the structure of Hadoop. It's very easy to understand even without any background knowledge.,5
8531,I like this course.,5
8532,I found this program extremely useful to understand the concepts of Big Data. I can now get into any conversation and do not feel li,5
8533,"For a introductory course it covers a lot of things, not in too much detail, but it covers a lot of important concepts and definitions.",4
8534,Great course and material. Well presented and practical!,5
8535,"Only skims the surface of Big Data, even for an introduction course.",3
8536,good course,5
8537,"Good introductory course on Big Data. It does not dive directly into the technical aspects, but rather discusses the various related topics giving a clear overview of the overall Big data scenario.Helped a lot in understanding the Big Data landscape.",5
8538,So much better than in the first version of the specialization! the peer reviewed project is a welcome addition to help understanding map reduce concepts,4
8539,"A good introduction, looking forward to the rest of the specialization.",4
8540,the best lectures,5
8541,"Good content, good teacher. Maybe should have a little more hands on assignments, but it is an excellent introduction to the topic!",5
8542,"This is an introduction course, and no advanced concepts are seen. I think it provides a good background, that is all. If you have a solid technical (programming, databases, etc.) knowledge maybe you will miss more hand-ons. For me, for an introductory and theoretical course I expected more resources, for example additional suggested readings, optional exercises...Lectures are well structured (intro and summary at the end), but I have missed presentations from some of the most interesting videos (week 6).",3
8543,"Much better than the previous version (2015) with all concepts very well explained, using examples to clarify them when necessary.I would have liked to go deeper with Hadoop (in last version of the specialization, Hadoop was a separate course), but anyway, as an Introduction to Big Data, this is an excellent course.",5
8544,This course got upgraded from 2015 to 2016. I wish I did not have to take twice because all the assignments and material seemed the same. Maybe next time you upgrade give students the credit for the classes they already took.,4
8545,"Really interesting course! Just dipping your toes into Big Data, and running some extremely basic operations, shows you how powerful Hadoop can be, and the potential for it :)Coming from someone with no experience in computer science.",5
8546,Very good specialization,5
8547,Fantastic Course. I'm so happy i took this class,4
8548,"Quite Informative and also touches the basics of Hadoop , Cloud Computing , Data Science.Really enjoyed studying it.",5
8549,"This is much better than the previous version! 6 weeks with much more spread out and comprehensive contents about big data with a nice balance between theory and hands-on assignments.Technical software taught are Hadoop, following the MapReduce framework, to which the introduction was very gentle and progressive. Thus, it makes it manageable to take in the and learn the rope by small baby steps.",5
8550,It's exhaustive and resourceful course to the introduction to Big data,5
8551,A good orientation class to level set key terms and concepts.,4
8552,Good intro,4
8553,"There is room to improve, but much better than previous version. Thanks for your good work as a good resource on learning about big data",4
8554,Great course. Thanks.,5
8555,Amazing course !,5
8556,Excellent and interesting course. Very well put together and presented.,5
8557,Superb course with great structure and well designed modules and videos. You end up with a very practical toolbox to think about business models in a very disciplined way.,5
8558,"Great course, very inspir",4
8559,Very interesting and professionalizing !! Moreover it is done in a way that keeps you in the need for more lectures !,5
8560,"Very good examples throughout the course : JCDecaux, the Spanish theatre, Michelin...",5
8561,"What a great course, I have to say that it has helped me a lot and specially now where I am setting up my new business. Congratulations to both of them for having inspiring me during the course. A bientôt FP",5
8562,Odyssey 3.14 is an excellent approach to business models and I appreciate this MOOC that makes this jewel available to a wide audience.,5
8563,"I would have like a longer course about these arguments. Anyway it offers really a lot of examples, effective analytic tools and ispirations to develop innovation in the business.",4
8564,Truly a pioneering course that has been explained in simple and straight forward terms yet highly effective context-based case studies. High valuable for start-up entrepreneurs. business unit managers and intraprenuers. This is exactly why HEC is one of the world's best business school. Thank you for delivering a world-class course.,5
8565,this is a really good one and of course I had a very good time during the course and really great thanks to the educators of the course and coursera,5
8566,i think this is avery good course thank you for it,5
8567,It´s a requirement to put down a payment to take the quiz,1
8568,Good topic great teachers,5
8569,"Informative, organized, and targeted for learning. Dr. Pienta and the other Hopkins professionals involved in putting this course together did an excellent job and were engaging throughout. I hope more material like this from Johns Hopkins becomes available in the not-so-distant future.",5
8570,"I work for a worldwide cancer research charity and found the course to be an excellent, challenging introduction to cancer biology. I particularly liked the fact that the course pointed towards some of the major questions that researchers are working around the clock answer, and that core materials were supplemented with examples of current research.",5
8571,"It was a great course form my favorite university, thanks very much for giving us this types of courses, I would like to be tested as a free course, but I coudn't",4
8572,"Great introductory course for cancer. It is simple enough for a novice to understand, and complex enough for someone who works in the field to gain additional knowledge. Great lectures.",5
8573,"Excellent class. I learned a lot. I like how they delivered the information into clear comprehensible segments. It was easy for follow the class, as it was well organized and clear.",5
8574,One of the best but would have been more awesome and worthy if the quizzes were free too,5
8575,"Too basic knowledge, not enough information about targeted therapy, everything is explained without going into any details",2
8576,Thank u for giving a attractive lecture and it really heIp me for future research.,5
8577,"I am an Undergraduate student and i didnt even read oncology subject, but this course not just start the beginer level , butt gradually it goes in depth and the flow of lectuures and topics is smooth",5
8578,"Excellent,thanks very much.",5
8579,A great and comprehensive course covering all the basic concepts of cancer!,5
8580,"Great course, great motivatiin instruction, now I must pursue more cancer-related learning venues",5
8581,"Excellent course. Introduction to cancer at a general biological and pathofysiology level, as well as specifically in terms of risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of the six most common types of cancer.",5
8582,great course with very experience lecturers . it has helped me to gain more insight into cancer development. thank you so much Dr. Kenneth J. Pienta and the other doctors. God bless you all.,5
8583,Loved the way they explained everything. But the tests are very easy.,4
8584,Wonderful course. Very informative and exceptionally well designed. I have learnt so much that will help me with my work in Integrative oncology and botanical medicine.,5
8585,Great course!,5
8586,a rally good introduction,5
8587,"I am a biochemist and will be working on a cancer-related problem as a postdoc. This course was very helpful for me as it provided a clear general understanding of cancer, and I would have rated it five stars if it wasn't for multiple typos and inaccuracies in the course materials ;)",4
8588,good for basic knowledge in cancer biology.,5
8589,Great introduction for new leaner.,4
8590,Great course !!!,5
8591,Easy to follow and full of basic knowledge.,5
8592,I've learned a lot - thank you!,5
8593,"Thank you so much for providing such a interesting course, especially thanks for financial support, I will be always there for courser, cant forget the great he",5
8594,very good course .benifit and more helpfull in our life and studies,5
8595,"Very informative, easy to understand.",5
8596,"Extremely informative, but loses 1 star for reserving tests ONLY for members with subscriptions",4
8597,Great explanation of basics of cancer biology. It helped me a lot in understanding of the process of metastasis and cancer development.,5
8598,"This course is awesome. As a current research technologist in this field, this course gives me great knowledge of cancer. I recommend anyone who is interested in this field. However, this course by itself won't give you everything. It is a course where you want to begin with if you want to begin a career of this field.",5
8599,i love this course very much,5
8600,Very useful any knowledge acquiring course,5
8601,"I like this course it was so enjoyable helpful to me since I wanted to learn more about cancer biology and I got the perfect opportunity to sign into this course! thanks to all coursera team and Jhons Hopkins university school for giving their time and effort to make this course.I liked the way of teaching by the doctors. at first, i thought it would be so difficult because I didn't have the right professional background about cancer biology and I wanted to start my own journey into fighting this disease but i didn't know where to start. suddenly, I found that this course and I've signed!i have some suggestions about this course:please put serious moderators not an ex-coursera students with some privilegeplease put some sizes options for the translation",5
8602,I got out of it what I expected as a person who does not work in any medical field. But I did not like the fact that we did not see a person giving the lectures and only the diagrams were visible. Every Coursera course I have taken thus far has always had the instructor visible as he or she lectured. It gave me the feeling of being in an actual classroom setting which I like. There was some information which was well beyond my level of knowledge . I am a college graduate but my degree is in social science. Then there were quiz questions which were on the more advanced information . I passed on my third try though.,5
8603,"Wonderful course, lots of information. Dr. Pienta is an excellent teacher. Thanks also to his staff and lab assistants for helping to create such a well-designed program. I will definitely recommend this course to others!",5
8604,it is very informative and useful course for memany thanks for all of you,5
8605,Very interesting for those that are not specialists and cancer and want to understand better it biology.,5
8606,It is my first on line coursera course and I liked it very much. Its a very good opportunity to review and learn about cancer.,5
8607,This course is absolutely ecstatic because the professor is nice and he always comes up with the smartest and most complex information a topic during the lesson!,5
8608,This course was put very simply and understandably. The information was useful in my projects and I am now able to understand terminology used in medical journals. Thank you Dr. Pienta!,5
8609,Very nicely organized course.,5
8610,very good course,5
8611,I'm happy to find such an interesting course. Thank you very much!,5
8612,Very good course! Congratulation to PhD Pienta and his group.,5
8613,Thanks professors. Great course & good efforts.,5
8614,"An excellent course! Whoever is interested in the development and metastasis of cancer should take this course. The lectures are very well presented and structured, so they are quite easy to follow even for a layman. I found the part on the hallmarks of cancer particularly interesting - a course that would go into more detail here would be on my wish list for future courses.",5
8615,"Great Course, was literally hooked as content was very informative and well structured. Not too overwhelming with massive information. This is a brief but effective intro to cancer - however if you are not from a medical background you do have to do some background reading to understand pathways and functions of sub cellular components.",5
8616,"Clear, thorough and interesting course!",5
8617,"The course has a high quality. The teaching method is clear and easy to understand. Instructors also provide a lot of graphs which are helpful. Though the course is easier than I expected, I still think it's a good course for students who want to know fundamental knowledge about cancer biology.",5
8618,Very High Quality,5
8619,This is very interesting course of basic of cancelling pathway and the biology of cancer that can fundamental to the study of research of cancer. Thanks.,4
8620,"It will be very helpful to me for doing my research work on the very same topic.But all of these courses should be free of cost,just like this one.Thanking you once again !Regards.",5
8621,Thoroughly enjoyed this online course,4
8622,"Very good course giving a broad overview of what cancer is and how we diagnose and cure it.Don't expect to be a specialist of cancer after it, it's only an introduction. But it is a good introduction giving some bases if you want to go further.",5
8623,Depth and volume of information perfectly balanced,5
8624,"Excellent course, thanks!",5
8625,"I Higly recomend this course if you dont know mutch about cancer and you are interested iin learning about it, the information is prety simple (i am studing medicin so it may not be as simple for other people) but is very usfull and it gives an idea about the basics of cancer.Thanks for this course and sorry if my english is not perfect... i speek spanish",4
8626,"This course was really good, and I learned a lot. Thanks!!!",5
8627,Comprehensive overview of the biology of cancer!,5
8628,Great introductory course to cancer. I love how the course includes the clinical side as well as the biological implications of cancer and provides the information in a very simplistic style. The coursework is not overwhelming and I loved this course.,5
8629,Good course to familiarize yourself with cancer biology.,5
8630,"Well structured, amazing instructors!",5
8631,"Thanks so much! Professor Kenneth Pienta and your team, you are so well prepared and the presentation is empowering. One is able to follow the step by step flow of information and tips. I enjoyed this course. As a health educator/promoter, it helps me act as a good source of information. Thank you once again.",5
8632,amazing course ..thanks,5
8633,"The course was excellent, with very good structure, with the right level of difficulty/complexity, with very good slides & discussions. The only couple of points for potential amendments that I would propose is a) avert from calling/mentioning drugs with their brand names, but rather use the active ingredient names only, and b) perhaps providing resources for further reading (i.e web links etc) to all material after each lecture, like you did for week 6 final lecture.",5
8634,Enriching experience for the adventurous student.,5
8635,"Well-structured course, Dr. Pienta and his fellow team-members are passionate in what they do, and that's evident during the course, but I can't help to think that they have barely scratched the surface here... The lectures are good, they provide a lot of information, but the quizzes offer no challenge whatsoever. That was somewhat disappointing, it felt like I was cheating. All in all, I don't regret buying and completing the course, but I really hope that Dr. Pienta's team will be back soon with a more challenging and advanced course.",4
8636,"Nice overview, not worth 50 bucks.",4
8637,"This Course is so interesting , it is full of alot of treasures and alot of informations. Thank You",5
8638,really thank you very much I am thankful of that course,5
8639,"I loved this course as I found the topic fascinating (the 10 hallmarks absolutely blew my mind - those cancer cells are so conniving!). I think the instructors did a fantastic job delivering the material.I am a Product Manager in the software industry, and I took this class for my personal curiosity.I wish we were able to submit the answers to the quiz without officially purchasing the course. I did not purchase the course as it does not pertain to my profession and I do not really need a certification for it.",5
8640,this course very useful to my that i gained a lot of information from this course.,4
8641,An excellent course for reviewing the basics of oncology,5

8643,"It is quite informative and useful course for begginers. I'm working with clinical trials, so I know so many cases, so many details, but this course has made a basement for my building.Thank you! Highly recommended for those, who know smth, but want to make all knowledge in order and prepare your 'brain shelves'",5
8644,This course emphasis brief introduction to biology of cancer. Here by simple words and examples you can discover which risk factors can cause cancer and what prevention needs to be done to minimize chance of cancer occurrence etc. I will suggest this course to all my colleges.

8645,The course is quite simple and easy to follow. Very suitable for students who have no understandings in this area. The workload is also small so I suggest those who were major in biology or chemistry you dont have to follow this course.,5
8646,Perfect,5
8647,"Hello all. I'm glad I took this course successfully. However, I have some notes. As a 4th year medical student, I see that the information is superficial. I finished the course in around 3 weeks, so medical students wouldn't get so much benefit out of the course. I wanted to learn more details, specially in depth about each type of the 5 cancers from the basics to clinical. Secondly, there was no interaction between the students and the doctor supervising the course in the discussion blogs. Thirdly, I believe that the assessment was too easy. I suggest a 60% passing grade with a more challenging assessment. Finally, this is my personal opinion. I enjoyed the course and I would like to see more improvement in the future.",1
8648,It'sgood,5
8649,"I mean, I am really fond of Biology and the Biotechnology, I think I will really appreciate this opportunity.",4
8650,Very good introduction. light-weight explanations.Better animations and videos could enhanced the learning process.questions are too easy.Needs more complex tasks to integrates the different sections together.,3
8651,very intresting course,5
8652,The class was clear and concise. I was hoping to get more challenge and in depth explanation but it is indeed an introductory class.,4

8654,An excellent and intriguing course. Well structured.,5

8657,A very good primer on the most common cancer types. I hope to see a more advanced iteration of this course for those who want deeper understanding.,5
8658,"I really enjoyed the course. Very professional training, with lots of insight in cancer therapy.",4
8659,"This was an interesting cancer basics class -- quick and simple for those with minimal background in oncology. The only disappointment was that the course description mentioned quizzes could be taken for no cost, but that turned out not to be true. Nevertheless, it was a valuable course.",4
8660,A wonderful course to get started or polish the concept.,5

8675,This was an excellent course for people interested in learning about cancer. I enjoyed it.,5
8676,I found this course useful and appropriate in the material offered and the assessed questions as an introduction and an update in cancer biology for CPD purposes. It is rather disappointing that the final grade achieved is not printed on the certificate. For A$65 to join the course and not have the full information such as the hours involved and the final grade achieved makes it very disappointing not to reflect the effort I put in as well as tricky to include this course as part of a CPD program.,3
8677,So far it's a very good course. I always wanted to learn about cancer as it took two lives from my family. I would give it a FIVE STAR if the professors could explain more elaborately as I have very little experience in this field. Thanks a lot,4

8682,I just completed week one and I am thoroughly impressed with this course so far. Outstanding work!,5
8683,I wish that the classifications of the major cancer groups were more descriptive. concerning the treatment for different types of lung cancer for example. Nothing is mentioned about childhood cancers or the area of lymphomas. I realize that this is an overview of cancer but cancer cell biology and current treatment practices based on immunologic findings were not given the coverage they deserve.,3
8684,"Interesting introduction, very detailed with screening, staging (TNM) and treatment steps per most common cancers worldwide. Very clinical and with a glimp of promising research (clinical trials), only the counselling part of the patient is missing in this course.",5
8685,"Tough call on this. The course itself is excellent [5] but the ""money grab, you must pay attitude"" is horrible [0].",3
8686,Very good for beginners who have no inkling to cancer biology at the slightest.,5

8706,Great learning experience.,5
8707,"Although very interesting, this course seemed too short for me.Professor Kofman is an expert in the filed, but he mostly reads thewords on the slides and shows little or no passion or interest in sharing hisideas and work whatsoever.",3
8708,Great and valuable teachings!,5
8709,"Just good to catch the basics. Sometimes quite boring to follow the professor, but it covers the basics adequately.",3

8730,Exceptional course in all regards!,5

8734,Too much information loaded.,3
8735,More challenging questions expected.,2
8736,"If you are a finace or business student this is not for you, its a complete re-run of most of the basics that re taught with some practical real life examples. Good for a person who is new to the subject of business or finance.",3

8839,Very helpful.,5
8840,"Excellent content, as it is concise and clear.",5
8841,"Testing choice isn't great. Writing a letter, outline, etc. and submitting it for peer review would have been more productive. Furthermore, some questions in Week 2 test are confusing, the original meaning the test designer is trying to convey is, which dictates what the right answer is, isn't clear, giving too much room to interpretation not allowing the answer to be empirically right.",3
8842,Poor content. Clearly filler material for the specialization. :),1
8843,"The course was very short and very basic. I do not think it is fair to call it ""High-Impact Business Writing"" when all you get is an introduction to business writing.

8857,This is an amazing opportunity unfortunately I have to catch up. I plan on doing this on the 3 day weekend. I have put time aside specifically for my classes. I have already put it to practice just haven't had a chance to do the quiz on lesson 1 or work on lesson 2. Again this is really a great way to help people out.

8868,Teacher Sue Robins competently and interesting has submitted all material. I am grateful for training on this course!,5
8869,The course was very generic and didn't teach that much. Sorry.,2
8870,Love it!!,5
8871,"The modules had a lot of aspects and covered each one in detail. However, it would have been helpful to have some hands-on exercises like writing an executive summary, evaluating a resume, writing an elevator pitch etc so that people learn from each other. Otherwise, its a great course with emphasis on different aspects of business writing. Thanks",3

9002,I think it is an essential course for all job seeker.,5
9003,so important to get or submitting or a job vacancies,5
9004,I'm grateful with the opportunity this course has offered me. It gives me new and better forms of knowledge of which I believe are very useful for future use. It doesn't only give me an opportunity to grow intellectually but also it gives me the chance to experience learning with people of different races from different places.

9006,Good course for me but area need to be improved is the course navigation.,4
9007,All I would like to know about how to prepare myself for career development.,5
9008,Relevant and interesting choice of assignments.,5
9009,"Excellent course in strategic management, a perfect capstone to apply knowledge.",5
9010,Culmination of the courses - to reinforce the learnings,4
9011,Course was extremely current and allowed me to creatively present all my ideas.,5
9012,Great way to put all the knowledge in context,5
9013,Nice and interesting.,4
9014,Exceptional curriculum layout with thoughtful lectures and assignments.,5
9015,I wish it had more interaction with the teachers or to at least have more level of detail on the cases. I am afraid tha as a final project it was not of a very high use for me.,3
9016,"The content and the assignment were of high quality and I really enjoyed the case I had to work on.So overal the course was very good, but negative was that the course was a bit too long, I understand Coursera needs to finance the course, so it is better to have a long one and earn a lot of subscription fees. Bu the extra review rounds felt redundant, and because the course was so long it was difficult to keep focussed on it.",4
9017,Being in this class and specialization was a great experience to me. Great instructors with great content but I prefer a professional person judge the final assignment of capstone.,5
9018,"Amazing way to demonstrate your knowledge, the only con is that the projects are peer reviewed, so no experts judge you.",5
9019,Awsm course!!!! Precise and well structured...........Wish CBS introduces more courses.,5
9020,"All the projects are real life cases. They are close to our life, challenging but also engaging, Doing this project makes me able to implement the theoretical frameworks in real situation.",5
9021,Interesting subjects to chose from. Also nice and short format of the assignment.,4
9022,"I must say that the Capstone Project was a good assignment. The issue is that the Peer Reviews were bad. I had to resubmit my assignment due to a student that choose to give me 0's when the other reviewers gave me 5's. There was also a bias to what each reviewer thought the capstone should cover so you had no idea which direction to update your work because the next reviewer may feel that the type of analysis you did was not Necessary.The course needs a specific Rubric and specific methods each person has to use in order to complete the assignment. For example, Must Use the Four Forces Model when evaluating Strategy. This way everyone knows what to expect and what to look for. Otherwise you can get a low grade on a great project because a Classmate thought you should have used another model so he gave you a 1 or 0 when the model you used demonstrated your knowledge.Capstones need to be monitored either by a student or assistant to protect against trolls that don't read your work and give you the lowest score. Otherwise the Course was great and the information was definitely well put together. The Peer Reviews brought my overall grade lower because I didn't get the High Mark I should have.",2
9023,Excellent course. Great learning. Top Notch facility. Definitely recommended for somebody who want to learn Strategy Management in detail.,5
9024,Thanks to Nicolai Pogrebnyakov and All Specialization Sectors. Good Course. If you want to have Practical Strategy Formulation and Implementation habits than Enroll !!!,5
9025,very helpful on creating the strategic recommendation for Spotify.,5
9026,"Very interesting topics for projects! And real executive from ""Bombardier"" has reviewed my work! It is good surprise.",5
9027,"The course as a whole is excellent (5 stars), however, the Capstone project part of the specialization consists of 3 submissions that are reviewed by other students. Consequently the quality of the reviewers are of the same level as the student itself - which obviously limits the learnings from feedback.",3
9028,"During the specialization I only missed some support material. it was a fantastic courser, thanks.",5
9029,Excellent course and teachers! Congratulations!,5
9030,Fantastic learning experience. Thanks!,5
9031,"Ira Pohl is a great professor. There were a few glitches in the videos, but overall a nice course.",4
9032,I enjoyed this course a great deal. The review of C++ and introduction of C++11 is exactly what I was looking for. The Hex Game assignment were fun. I was impressed at how the Monte-Carlo method could be used to create an AI player for a game.,4
9033,Good contents,5
9034,Very helpful.,5
9035,Fantastic course,5
9036,Just Brilliant,5
9037,Excellent Course! Learning is not done by rote but rather by understanding the material.,5
9038,very clear and useful.,4
9039,Very good course. The teacher is great. Thank you.,5
9040,"Top level, very interesting and absolutelly exciting!",5
9041,"Great professor, but a lot of formatting issues with the problems. To avoid considerable frustration, make sure you reference this page:https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1/discussions/forums/WcY9_8ayEeSWEiIAC0wC5g/threads/CgOJwV-jEeWncxKXIFxpFQ",4
9042,Great Course! ... Thanks for Dr. Jim Fowler and Ohio State University.,5
9043,It was a pleasure to follow the videos. Professor Fowler's obvious enthusiasm for his subject shine through.,5
9044,Excellent course. Good teacher and dynamic learning.,5
9045,very good course to learn Caculus,5
9046,Great lesson! It's easy for the one who have left these for a long time.,5
9047,"With all of the changes going on with the coursera platform, some stuff gets changed or messed up. Otherwise, this is a great course! Would watch just for the faces.",4
9048,"The many errors in the quizzes and the basic structure of the course - like having no link to a textbook in a central location - makes the experience of the course very very poor. The quality of the material makes up for it, to some extent - but there needs to be more Coursera support (I think) to get the errors in quizzes and stuff sorted out. The mods are doing an amazing job keeping people calm, but Coursera needs to do better.",3
9049,"Excellent, simply fantastic. Thank you so much for the effort in creating these materials.",5
9050,Very fun to watch with great illustrations and explanations! Great course!,5
9051,Excellent course and Instructor was outstanding.,5
9052,I am definitely going to learn Calculus Two!!,5
9053,Very useful and interesting course. It gave me more than an opportunity to just compute some calculations. I've learnt WHY these calculations are in the form I use them.,5
9054,the best presentation I have ever seen,5
9055,Extreme Good Teaching Method!,5
9056,"This is a hard subject to teach myself. I found the instruction distracting. I think in attempt to be enthusiastic the instructors frittered away my attention. By terrible coincidence, my computer blew up. Real Life intervened in that and other ways. I will continue to try to learn calculus, but this didn't work for me.",2
9057,Great energy in the course. A lot of fun to work on.,5
9058,"I really enjoyed this course but week 9 was extremely ridiculous. I had a hard time relating the examples to the quiz and, when i finally figured it out, the answers were huge and complex numbers. Other then that though, i do recommend this course.",4
9059,"Beautiful course, very well explained with the right mix of theory and application of the learning. Many thanks to the professor and Coursera ! :)",5
9060,Only the most essential information about calculus. Highly recommend for people w/o math background.,5
9061,GREAT TEACHER,5
9062,ThankI'll study hard as a can!!,5
9063,Excellent course! Excellent and very energetic and likable teacher! Except minor technical issues with the quizzes it was perfect! For a similar experience involving a free certificate of completion I suggest http://ximera.osu.edu/,5
9064,"It was great, the videos were fun to watch, the teacher did a great job explaining everything, but it was also very challenging. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to embark on the study of calculus.",5
9065,Good course. I wish the technical aspects of submitting typed answers had all the bugs worked out. Otherwise great experience.,4
9066,"Very good explanation, interesting excercises.",5
9067,"I love the teacher so much! He can lead me to understand the mathimatic problems which are really difficult to me. And he also taught some ""life experience"" by calculus: in terms of life curve, when you feel you are ""decreasing"", which meaning f prime is less than 0, it's sad one way, but if the f prime prime is still greater than 0, you will recover again! So, keep moving~",5
9068,"Thank you, the course was nice, good job.",5
9069,This class is quite accurate and pleasing. I have enjoyed the course,4
9070,The lecturer is very enthusiastic. Explanations are crystal clear. Quiz material is good.,5
9071,The best calculus course I've ever taken. The professor is really enthusiastic and keeps you motivated. You will never get bored!,5
9072,"The course is clear, informative and yet not very hard. Jim Fowler is crazy looking but he's very engaging, you want to share his craziness about calculus, and by the end of the course I found myself enjoying when new approaches come from previously learned.The only one slight minus for me was, that there is no medium complexity ""homeworks"". Tests and exercises are sometimes too easy and repetitive. On the other side challenges given in lectures are too hard, and has no answers to check yourself .",5
9073,"Electric professor! Great course, without doubts.",4
9074,"This was the most challenging, rich, and fun Calculus I class. The instructor's high degree of motivation, personal interest, and sense of wonder at the beauty and far reaching manifestations of the laws that the Calculus attempts to capture is contagious and revives the sense of discovery and awe that Newton, Leibniz, Pascal, and Euler must have experienced. Great break down of complex subject matter into clear and concise language that even a dumb grunt, that is, an infantryman, could understand quickly and with anticipation for the next topic. My English teachers, Beckwith and Ellis, would certainly love that sentence.",5
9075,Thanks very much!,5
9076,"An excellent introductory course on single variable calculus, Jim is an amazing and engaging instructor. I wish he did more Mathematics courses.",5
9077,The instructor does a very poor job of explaining the material.,1
9078,There is no good explanation of how to calculate the equations given in the quizes which is why sometimes i had to fail to figure out how to solve one of the similar equations so I can understand and solve the others. Overall is good and understandable.,4
9079,"The course is great! Jim Fowler presents everything is such a meaningful and insightful way. And he's very funny. But Dr. Fowler, please change the music :)",5
9080,Dr. Jim Fowler makes Calculus a poetry. The concept oriented approach goes straight into the fundamentals before turning off the students' appetite with dry symbolic jargons. The same concept is explained from multiple perspectives making mastery of the material inevitable. I had the most fun learning from Dr. Jim Fowler the beauty of calculus.,5
9081,"The best Math Course in the world !! I mean it. ""Best In the world"". Excellently handled by Dr. Fowler.",5
9082,Great!,5
9083,Love this course. So interesting and so challenging.I like the way it's given and passion of Dr. Fowler motives so much,5
9084,Fantastic course. A lot of neat tricks thrown in too. Jim Fowler's enthusiasm is contagious.,5
9085,Thank you. A really useful comprehensive review of calculus & some applications.,5
9086,Exceptionally good Calculus course for those who had a Calculus course in their past and want to review some credentials !!!,5
9087,"Solid course - well taught by highly enthusiastic teacher. Good online support from other participants and course mentors. Only frustration was syntax - sometimes you would get the right answer in a test but the syntax was not recognised (for example sometimes the constant ""E"" had to be entered in lower case and sometimes in upper case.)",4
9088,"This course was a big help. It has many applications which help you visualize what calculus really is about; great teacher, great examples and such a great time learning this.",5
9089,"This is an amazing course taught by an emphatic, inspiring teacher! This not only eased the effort of learning but made it FUN. 10/10, would recommend to anyone wishing to learn Calculus.",5
9090,Very enthusiastic lecturer!,5
9091,The Prof. ever :),5
9092,Best Online class ever!,5
9093,Purely awesome,5
9094,"Educator is outstanding!!! If more mathematics teachers were like him, then we would have more people admiring and using mathematics, the greatest of all human inventions!",5
9095,Teacher is very enthusiastic and good at providing intuitives for theorems.,5
9096,"Thanks Jim and relative staffs. You help me to understand the Calculus in deep, and know that Math is really fun and helpful. Though I leaned it several years ago, but now I really get some new concepts about it. Thanks every again!",5
9097,that's an extraordinary course. Congratulations,5
9098,Every minute I spent on this course was useful in improving my knowledge of calculus. Many thanks to Jim.,5
9099,"I would like to thank Jim Fowler, PhD at this point. The content of the course was explained very understandably, best thanks for it and all the best.",5

9102,Very clear explanation.,5
9103,I loved it. He is a very good professor.,5
9104,Covered the material I needed to progress into mathematics; provides nice intuition about the concepts; very engaging.,5
9105,"Professor Fowler is an excellent teacher, and The Ohio State knows it.",5
9106,comprehensive skills for basic calculus :),5
9107,Very good course. As someone with attention difficulties. The lecturer was very engaging and made learning fun.,5
9108,"if the input format can be explained in detail, could save a lot of time wondering the genuine ""answer"". But, overall, brilliant! really appreciate for the sharing of joys in calculus! thank you!",4
9109,"It is impossible to input solutions to quizzes/exams - even when they are correct, they are graded as wrong - a massive waste of time",1
9110,I wish that Mr. Jim Fowler were my math teacher in high school,5
9111,"Good, step by step explanation.",5
9112,Great lecturer. It is perfect in tandem with the mooculus's textbook (https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts),5
9113,Professor is very passionate and the lecture is easy to understand for someone like me who speaks English as a second language .,5
9114,Very intereting,5
9115,"fun,practical and fulfilling,thank you so much.",5
9116,"very motivated tutor, easy to understand and beginners friendly.",5
9117,The best course I have ever taken. This professor is very enthusiastic about his subject. He is committed to teach proper understanding of topics and gradually builds students intuition.,5
9118,This is a great overview/refresher course for Calculus. The lectures cover more material than the quizzes.,5
9119,Great!,5
9120,The way Jim Fowler teaches calculus is amazing. He feels what he's lecturing and it's motivating to go through his videos and then hit the assignments. It's incredible how much calculus our everyday lives is sorrounded and we can only apprecciate that by taking courses like these. I do reccommend it. Thanks for the amazing course! It's incredible,5
9121,The course is very well structured and has helped me better understand calculus.,5
9122,"I have never had calculus explained to me so well before attending this course, Thank you!",5
9123,This one got away from me. I think I need Calculus for Dummys!,3
9124,"The professor does a great job explaining the ideas behind the mathematics. He makes it very easy to understand. However, there are not a lot of problems, so it's best to complement this with some textbook exerc",5
9125,very good course you can review calculus,4
9126,It is very good course and give a better understand in calculus.,4
9127,Exceptional course! This was a wonderful review of calculus.,5
9128,A very nice course! I love his great pasion on calculus!,5
9129,"I believe that the teacher creates a great way of explaining what seems to be very complicated thought processes, and he does so in a highly enthusiastic manner.The only downside is that such explanations can be either too low level or not strong enough to explain certain phenomena. For example, the professor talks about how the absolute value function of x is not differentiable at zero, and how a function is differentiable at a certain point when the two-sided limit exists and, by extension, the function is continuous at that same given point. However, the professor in this regard never truly explains why the v-shape is not differentiable and how it relates to our definition of continuity. However, overall: a very worthwhile course and a pleasant experience.",4
9130,"I really feel like I understood a great deal from this course. The exercises were challenging and sometimes required me to rewatch the videos, ensure my notes were good, and look up some help in other places online. I feel like calculus is fun, and I'm looking forward to doing more! I feel quite prepared to take on some calculus courses in person now.",5
9131,Incredible level of teaching.,5
9132,This comical man makes me very annoy.,2
9133,i never seen some one passionate about calculus like Dr. jim fowler i really learned alot from this course,5
9134,Explains what calculus is well,5
9135,Excellent instruction! An amazing resource for anyone interested in learning/re-learning calculus!,5
9136,Great... a bit more variation int he quizzes would be nice,4
9137,"A refresher of Calculus doesn't get better than this! Jim is a thoroughly engaging teacher, and the lessons deliver concise yet detailed explanations of basic calculus concepts. While I have not put in enough time to master every concept learned in this class, I have come away feeling like I know enough for basic applications. Highly recommended!",5
9138,Awesome course!,5
9139,Awsome!,5
9140,"This course is awesome. To listen to professor Jim Fowler break down seemingly hard concepts into easy-to-understand chunks is hugely satisfying. But make no mistake. The course is not easy. But if you put in the effort, you will find it very fulfilling.The last three sections (weeks 14, 15, and 16) are probably the best parts of the course. It’s thrilling to experience professor Fowler solve hairy integration problems with u substitution and integration by parts.The grading section is a little buggy and may cause frustration for learners. But overall, you can work around the bugs if you take the time to review the bug list in the discussion forums.The mentors are fantastic and provide quick responses to your questions on the forums.",4
9141,"He teaches the intuitions as much as the calculations. I didn't memorize everything (it's hard and unnecessary), but when i see a function or a question, after drawing a graph, i can see through it all the integrations, derivatives, geometry etc. Thank you so much Jim :)",5
9142,"Really sparkly! But more is required, for example after studying integral it would be nice to study double and triple integrals. After derivatives it would be logical to go through partial derivatives and so on.",5
9143,This is one of the best courses I have taken on Coursera and I would really like to thank Our Course Professor Jim Fowler and The Ohio State University for this beautiful course on Calculus.One thing I wanted to mention is to include more examples in practice exercises and module quizzes for better understanding and visualization of the concepts.,5
9144,Calculus for complete dummies by a terrific instructor.,5
9145,"Well done and useful. I have found a passionate professor, a fascinating subject and a superior exercise for the mind.",5
9146,Very clear instructions! Jim really knows about calculus and he knows how to teach well.,5
9147,"Great course, easy to understand, with nice and sometimes funny explanations of difficult problems",5
9148,Excellent course. I took this course as a refresher to tackle a few projects involving machine learning. Highly recommend to anyone taking machine learning/AI courses. It helped me better understand and properly implement back propagation algorithm in my neural network involving a hyperbolic function.,5
9149,"I want more additional lecture please prof fowler.. very longed! to learn multivariate, parametric, differential equations, linear algebra, analysis and so on. I will wait for your lecture sincierely..",5
9150,One of the best courses i have taken as an Online and Tradional student.,5
9151,the best thing ever in my life,5
9152,had an awsome experience.learning made much easier .,5
9153,Very nice introduction to Calculus! The instructor is just great!,5
9154,An outstanding course with extraordinary intuition behind to make clear basic calculus. Many thanks for the content and especially for the creativity and motivation of the lecturer to deliver the lessons.,5
9155,Ever since I started i don't want to stop,5
9156,This course represents everything Coursera aspires to be. If only other Coursera professors cared 10% as much as Dr. Fowler in teaching.,5
9157,HiMath is a great science.Great Course and a Great Teacher.Thank you,5
9158,Excellent course and teacher! Right energy for people like me. ;),5
9159,It was a very good course. I enjoyed the learning experience very much.,5
9160,"Prof Fowler does an outstanding job of making sure the concepts behind the formulas make sense. That was important to me, and this course delivered.",5
9161,wonderful instructor,5
9162,"Great course! It's fantastic the way that the professor explains calculus, his way to teach makes him one of the best professors I've ever had. And it's a course that doesn't take several hours of your time, it's simple and straight to the point. I'm really impressed by how they made such a well structured course for online students. I could really notice that people who worked producing this course really worked to make it the best as possible.I can't wait to start Calculus 2!Regards from Brazil! Thank you all from Ohio University.",5
9163,Great Course Instructor with lots of Humor... Dude makes calculus easy!!! Thumbs up to the production guys the music at the end and beginning of the course is really exciting... I LOVE THIS COURSE!!!,5
9164,"A really good moth course!The teacher uses a simple way to introduce the Calculus knowledge to us!Thanks, Coursera!",5
9165,"I took this class to fulfill a prerequisite for my graduate program, and it was outstanding -- easily the best online class I have taken to date. The professor is enthusiastic and explain things very well. Not only is the material broken into manageable chunks, but the supporting exercises and textbooks are really helpful too. I highly recommend it.",5
9166,Lecture videos are good. Assessment of knowledge (quizzes) are weak.,3
9167,An excellent course. Has a focus on underlying concepts and intuitions. Could be hard to follow without recent exposure to math. I recommend doing Khan Academy videos and exercise prior to taking this course or in parallel.,5
9168,"Calculus is not an easy part in math, so i didn't hope that i could get through it as quick as possible. But from when i got this course, i see that to access a mindset of math's world needs persevere and connection basically.",4
9169,"I've always had a love for math, however I never did well in the subject in school. It's a paradox, but embarrassingly I struggled to even pass! Well, once I found this course, I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I took it. I've learned new and applied concepts in math and Mr. Fowler makes the lectures easy to understand. The discussion forum and mentors are extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this course to others.",4
9170,"The professor does an outstanding job explaining the various ways in which the fundamental concepts in Calculus including limits, derivatives and integrals, build upon the underlying algebra. I highly recommend this course to both students and educators.",5
9171,"Awesome. I always to learn mathematics with real world view and applications rather than manipulations of symbols and abstract thinking - not that this way of learning is wrong , just does not work for me. This is the great course to serve that purpose.",5
9172,This guy is awsome! :D,5
9173,"Best thing of this course is that it is self paced. No need to worry about submitting assignments or quizzez. However, this is also taking some tome to get it completed.",5
9174,You'd be lucky to take this course in calculus from this gifted teacher Jim Fowler,5
9175,the lectures are awsome... he is an extra ordinary teacher... i haven't any idea about limits even exam time @12 but i have the confidence now... :),5
9176,great teacher,5
9177,very good to learn!,5
9178,Really good course. It is really good for people who want to understand calculus. It is not a course for one that have final next week but is sure a great course for those who want to learn it in a solid base.,5
9179,You learn a lot with this course and the instructor is breath taking,5
9180,"Just one word to describe this MOOC , "" AMAZING"". Its been a great journey exploring the world of calculus.",5
9181,"The teacher is very passionate; therefore I enjoyed the topics that were taught very differently than when I took AP Calculus AB in high school. The answer input sections for the tests and quizzes were rather frustrating because I had to type very specific keys on the keyboard just to input a constant or a polynomial. And one typo caused me to fail some assignments. Also the decimal approximations were very specific to the point where if I didn't type an extra number in the tenths, hundredths, or thousandths place then I would get the answer wrong even if I did the problem correctly.",3
9182,"Dr. Fowler is passionate, engaging, and a great teacher. I highly recommend the course!",5
9183,"Quite easy to understand, the professors are active. Thank you for this class.",5
9184,"Easy to understand ""harder"" topic.",5
9185,Good course!!,4
9186,I'm more than satisfied with the amount of learning that I weekly get in this marvelous course,5
9187,Amazing Teacher. Thank u,5
9188,Brilliant teacher!,5
9189,Very clear introduction to calculus. Good value!,5
9190,Easy to understand basic concept of calculus but not so challenging.,4
9191,awesome course！The professor is very funny so that i can pay more attention to the content.,5
9192,It is an excellent course. I am a commerce grad without maths. i find it too good course. It is helping me a lot to understand calculus.,5
9193,"Thouhg I'm only 15,but Professor still make it easily to understand.It's great to learn such a course.",5
9194,Learning mathematics is enjoyable with Prof Fowler!!,5
9195,Very deep and informative for this level of Calculus,5
9196,Great Profesor!,5
9197,"you must use the exact format to get the correct answer on problems, or it will be marked wrongthe course is ""as is"" meaning when there are mistakes in the coursework neither web hosting nor faculty have are available to correct mistakesmoderators are not allowed to correct course content, so what they end up doing is editing your post in the forum. get use to this: ""A moderator deleted your post in Calculus One because of spam""""Review our forum Code of Conduct to learn more about guidelines for participating in course discussions"", but i and others are only posting problem areas, thus rendering the forum discussions uselesssince the moderators only have the power to delete and edit your post, there is a list of content errors for the course that you will need to look at. real smart. i asked to have my grade adjusted, but they deleted that post also",1
9198,A very good course because of its content and its professor. Thank you for your help.,5
9199,I absolutely love this course. The only thing that I would suggest is going into the trapezoid and Simpson's rule when evaluating areas under the curve.,4
9200,"It's really an excellent course with it's simple principles showing, great instructor professor JIM has very good communication skills and attentions pay, very satisfy",5
9201,Amazing course! Jim Fowler really gets one excited about doing and learning maths!,5
9202,"nice and great, makes me full of hope.",5
9203,It's so fun to learn calculus in this way! thanks!,5
9204,This course helped understand what I am actually doing with calculus.,5
9205,"The best Calculus course I have seen. It has lots of real world examples to introduce the concepts, and there is a great balance between intuition and mathematical rigour. The exercises are also timed perfectly to help understanding the concept.",5
9206,"It is a long but worthwhile course. I took it as a well needed refresher and ended up using two sessions to finish. The materials were available between formal sessions, so I could work it at my own pace and Dr Fowler makes it fun and clear. Definitely recommended.",5
9207,Great course!Coursera ... not so much.,5
9208,"Good for beginners, but maybe using examples instead of important concepts as elements of main structure can cause confusion.",4
9209,"Very interesting, well thought out and exciting course. The original style of the material supply by teacher ""from God"" is able to captivate any skeptic who believes that mathematics - science boring.",5
9210,Tutor Jim Fowler is amazing with the real life examples and the energy he shows in the sessions.,5
9211,"I have finished this course and moved on to the 2nd part. In sum, the course was excellent and Professor Fowler is terrific at explaining concepts both visually and algebraically. He provides both rigorous and intuitive explanations. I learned a lot and firmed up many concepts. i really appreciated the balance between visual and numerical. The real problem with the course is the quiz CPU. It does not recognize correct answers even when those answers are exactly the same as the ones provided by way of correcting your ""wrong"" answer. There is something really wrong with the quiz review code. That can be a ""downer"" when you are seeking a little encouragement after some hard work - and you know your answers are correct - and In Fact have been correct on the same questions in earlier quizzes. So take the coruse - enjoy the learning - but don't be discouraged because Coursera writes Kludgey code.IThe course is not yet over but perhaps someone will see this and make some changes. The professor is clear and enthusiastic. The main problem with this course is the quizzes. On several occasions I have submitted answers that were completely correct, only to find them all graded incorrect. I know they were correct because I had mathematician friends check them after receiving the failing grades. They could not understand why the quizzes were returned that way. On certain occasions, questions on one quiz were graded correct - and then the exact same type of question on another quiz was graded incorrect. In some cases, my answers were exactly the same as those probided by way of demonstrating the correct responses. Identical - yet marked wrong. When there are several ways to formulate an answer, we have no way of knowing what form is required. On a recent quiz, it turned out the answers were required in raw form - not solved to their numeric conclusion. But how are we to know that? I will write more at the end of the course. It is a good course for learning - but don't get upset if you get a bad grade. It is probably not an accurate reflection of your work. A final point - Professor Fowler should learn to pronounce ""integral."" It is NOT ""intregal."" It is ""integral."" He is, after all, a mathematician. You would not want a surgeon to speak of ""cradiac care,"" would you? Otherwise - terrific class.",4
9212,very well organized course!,5
9213,Great course,5
9214,"use simple words to explain complicated calulus, it is very wonderful. it is definitly worth your time.",5
9215,"The best introductory course to Calculus ever, with Dr Fowler, the best teacher ever.",5
9216,Just awesome. it simply needs to provide information on assignments when keyboard sucks.,4
9217,"Course seems fundamentally sound. Prof is enthusiatic and obvioulsy highly qualified. Really appreciate the proofs he provides such as the geometric development of the trig derivatives, the chain rule, and the fundamental theorem. I'd give it 5 stars for content and clarity.I am disappointed that some of the lectures were out of sequence with the quizzes and I really found that entering the answers to quizz questions was difficult. In some cases the tool misled me i.e. when the question indicated E should be entered for Euler's constant but the grading tool required e. Also in one instance the grading tool didn't recognize the right answer and I believe the correct answer wasn't even available as one of the choices.",4
9218,i love his enthusiasm,5
9219,Marvelous :-),5
9220,it will be more useful if using more complicated examples,5
9221,this is a good course,5
9222,Its a very good course. The teacher teachs with love and attention. I just think could have more exercises in video to help to do on the assignments. I recommend!!!!,4
9223,"Very well designed, taught with much enthusiasm. Just soak in some of his energy and you would be fine.",5
9224,A very well taught and approachable course. I highly recommend it.,5
9225,best... good to perfect your basic concept of calculus... recommended for everybody...,5
9226,I love your teaching style!,5
9227,The professor is great and I'm loving this course! I did have to use Khan Academy a couple of times so far but this is awesome. Good luck,5
9228,teacher doesn't teach what is on the quizzes. -_-,2
9229,This is a great courser!,5
9230,This prof is amazing. I could listen to him describe dirt. unbelievably engaging!!!,5
9231,This really taught me a lot,5
9232,I love it. I haven't learned anything about math since 8 years ago when I graduated from senior high school. And professor made me fall in love with calculus/math again. He is making every point clear in a easy-to-comprehend way. Thank you.,5
9233,Very helpful and new way to look at calculus. I am taking this course in order to freshen up concepts when I start AP Calculus my senior year and this offers me a comprehensive guide for what to except. Thank you!,5
9234,"Really great class! Goes a little fast at some parts, but otherwise engaging and interesting.",4
9235,very helpful,5
9236,"Useful and productive, tutor is good in a help to find a meaning of all this stuff.",5
9237,Very very good introduction course which covers single variable differentiation and integration. The teacher is awesome! His enthusiasm is so contagious that I'm going to go through his Calculus Two course as well just because he created it!,5
9238,"easy to follow, good examples and practice exercises.",5
9239,Its not five stars because there isn't portuguese legends,4
9240,Amazing Course,5
9241,"The teacher is full of energy, I like the way he taught.It brings me into the world of calculus!!! thanks:)",5
9242,It is very useful!,5
9243,It's easy to follow and fun way to learn calculus!,5
9244,This guy loves what he's doing :),5
9245,"This is one of the best introductory course to Calculus. The explanations are lucid, the instructor is awesome and the level of problems is good.",5
9246,"I think this course is great, I like everything about it, but I can't say the same about the quiz format, it is rigid and non-standardI gave up on the course many times because of thisHow do write Sqrt(5) for instance ? 5x must be 5*x or it is not acceptable.I am sorry, this is pretty bad",1
9247,"Excellent professor, induce students' interest",5
9248,The course is really good and clear. Love it,5
9249,"Really love this dude, and appreciate the self-pacing",5
9250,"An awesome course! The teacher is good, and the calendar is well organized.However, as to me, there are some points that have not been explained clearly and the some quizzes are just terrible.Hope to see the improvements.",4
9251,Good for Beginnes. Love you Jim Fowler!,5
9252,"Excellent, very good teacher",5
9253,"This was a very well presented course. Jim Fowler is a fantastic teacher; he makes it enjoyable and relevant. It would be nice if Coursera could review the quiz addenda and update the quizzes. It is very demoralizing to take and retake a quiz due to an incorrect answer, only to find out that the automatic grader is wrong! I'd gladly take more courses with this presenter.",5
9254,this is a perfect course by a great instructor,5
9255,GREAT COURSE! EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!!,5
9256,Cool,5
9257,Great instructor!,5
9258,Awesome lecturer,5
9259,Really an amazing course. Helped me get a deeper understanding of calculus. Teaching quality is outstanding and assumes very little prior knowledge. The course guides you through the logic of theorems in an intuitive way at the beginning and slowly introduces more complicated problems. Would recommend to anyone with no calculus experience or who took calculus years ago but never felt they mastered the core concepts.,5
9260,"Very well taught, but I think the exercises were disjointed and did not always fit with what was being taught. Other than that, great course!",4
9261,Awesome course!! It's just that sometimes its a little bit hard to understand XD,4
9262,"Very good course, I teacher of math",5
9263,"well-explained, good job",5
9264,This course is amazing! It is a great resource to prep for AP Calculus and other course,5
9265,"I took this course a long time ago but I remember that my experience was overly good, the teacher demonstrates the ideas of Calculus in very creative and visible ways and simplifies as much as possible the somewhat complicated ideas of Calculus.I self used also Paul's online notes to accomplish Calculus but if you're not very much into reading and you prefer very simple and clear videos this is the course for you (although I can't guarantee that everybody will relate to the style of this teacher).",5
9266,"The professor uses many examples to prove and emphasize the main points. It is a very valuable course, which is also free on Coursera.",5
9267,Very explanatory. Clear and simple explanations for mathematical complexities.,5
9268,Thorough helpful and student-friendly.,5
9269,The Instructor is amazing!,5
9270,Very useful.,5
9271,Very good. Thanks alot,5
9272,It's great!all the chapters are explained as well as i could imagine...,5
9273,Great and passionate professor.,5
9274,There are still many more technical issues which lie unsettled for months in in this beautiful and extremely interesting course...,4
9275,"Good course that covers some of the most fundamental concepts behind Calculus. Although the lecturer is quite ""in your face"", the lectures are well structured and well explained. The intro music at every lecture (every 3-5 minutes) is unnecessary and annoying.",4
9276,This professor rocks!,5
9277,Quite concise and learning great,5
9278,Love the way u guys teach. Each concept is clarified with examples. Everything seems so interesting and easy that once used to seem boring and difficult,5
9279,Need to take a hiatus; this would be the perfect class to prep for my TexEs teacher certification test in two years.,3
9280,"Free is good. The Professor is a little hurried when he speaks, that distract me from the lessons.However, I prefer this online class to the On Campus math classes I have completed at the Oak Harbor Campus of the Skagit Valley College.",5
9281,Great teaching methodology - although the test are a bit too centered on number crunching and not reasoning. (a lot of number crunching and no room for little numerical mistake although reasoning is good),3
9282,"The professor's teaching was fun. But you need to rewatch many times if you do not understand. Once you get it, you will blame why you didn't understand it at the first place because it's so simple and you'll then agree with what every words the professor said.",4
9283,Love the humour,5
9284,"The course itself is fantastic, but submissions toward the end of the course are extremely tedious and cause you to wonder whether or not you did the math correctly.",4
9285,"Great class, easier to learn calculus",5
9286,A very well designed course with clear explanations.,5
9287,great teacher gives great lectures,5
9288,very clear. It should be more exercise,5
9289,Professor Fowler is awesome!,5
9290,Very fast-paced at times but very informative. He creates an enthusiastic learning process.,4
9291,"Instructors make this class FUN, even for a dummy like me.",5
9292,Thank you for this course !!!,5
9293,amazing course and amazing teacher.,5
9294,"Great teacher with a very interesting content and approach. To totally benefit from this course, going through the associated Mooculus print is really complementary to the video. This enthusiastic mathematician, beyond the raw mathematics, will give you insights, practical and inspired examples or applications, interests, and much more. You might end up seeing integral calculus as an epic rpg battle versus an ogre after this course (special thanks to the professor for this amazing image ), but you would have been well trained, fully equipped, and wisely guided.",5
9295,"He is an awesome instructor, Love from India, Thanks for this course.",5
9296,Excellent course! The most clear way to learn Calculus! My grate thanks to the Lector!,5
9297,A really awesome course to learn calculus,5
9298,Great course.,4
9299,I think the instructor is great.,5
9300,Great!!!,5
9301,"Very good course, although too much long.",4
9302,"The course is best suited for an Intermediate student. Course is good to have since oit convers the topic from its very basic perspective. For graduates this course is more time consuming and dosnt recommended.Advantages:-very simple descriptions-even a non mathematical background student can easily understand-Proofs in all forms(geometric, analatic, practical) descrition.Disav:-basic are explained and consuming too much time-dosnt going for advanced level-no high level explanations or topics.",3
9303,"Jim Fowler is the best math teacher I have ever encountered, by far.",5
9304,Very well presented!,5
9305,This is an excellent course with the best kind of instructor! The explanation is pellucid. The examples and exercises are very practical. Thank you Jim for such a masterpiece of online education!,5
9306,Videos are actually enjoyable to watch. The prof is an interesting dude.,5
9307,This guy might be the best instructor of anything I've ever seen anywhere.,5
9308,Extremely useful and student friendly!,5
9309,"The professor is passionate and makes learning calculus as easy as possible. Plenty of videos and explanations, but not many realistic problems given.",4
9310,"So lucky to take part in this course, since it gives me a chance to learn Calculus again. Thanks Mr. Fowler.",5
9311,"Solid course. Good instructor. The quizzes, however, often were inconsistent on how to input Euler's number so that it could be read by the computer. 1 quiz had an item that did not contain a question (Thank god it was multiple choice) , and the last exam asked you to select between two answers which identical except for the fact that one added zero from x and one subtracted zero from x.",4
9312,I love the instructors enthusiasm!!,5
9313,"Professor Jim Fowler is FANTASTIC! He makes calculus thoroughly understandable, and memorable. His enthusiasm is infectious. Thank you, Coursera, for such a marvelous course. I will continue to Calculus Two.",5
9314,great course,5
9315,"This prof. is great, he make Calculus much easier",5
9316,Superb course - Jim Fowler is an excellent teacher.,5
9317,Outstanding contribution to math education. Excellent course. Thank you kindly and best wishes.,5
9318,Very energetic lecturer :) Thoroughly enjoyed.,4
9319,"Very interesting, thank you~",5
9320,Thank you professor :) you are a great teacher,5
9321,"Terrific instructor. Cover difficult topics well and in a very fine progression with very good transitions.Good explanations and good examples of concepts. Workable, useful knowledge gained. A very fine professor with a clear interest in teaching students.",5
9322,quite interesting... better if was aware of the site few week before,5
9323,C,1
9324,Simply ¡Excellent!,5
9325,This is one of the best courses I've ever taken. I recommend it 100%!!,5
9326,it was quite mind opening to me. as it help me to relate calculus from note to reality and vice versa,5
9327,Great course that I have known before.,5
9328,i love the explanation,5
9329,This course is awesome !,5
9330,THANK YOU !!,5
9331,excellent course just let down by the frustrations of the inconsistencies of the marking of quizzes,4
9332,Dr Jim Fowler is a great mathematician and an outstanding instructor. Thanks a lot!,5
9333,"Professor Fowler is great! He spends some time explaining the theory behind the topic, and makes everything pretty easy to visualize. I would love if there were a few more resources with example problems. The quizzes can be pretty challenging, if you haven't done any practice problems first. My favorite thing about this MOOC and Prof. Fowler is his excitement--which makes it feel, less like a lecture and more, like a fun conversation about calculus.",4
9334,love the explanation. but it would be highly appreciated if some practice material was provided which would be reviewed by experts after completion.,4
9335,Excelent course! I'll do the next Calculus two!!,5
9336,Great course for calculus introduction.,4
9337,The teacher is very passionate. The lectures are quite in detail and well explained.,5
9338,Good course to take!,5
9339,"Great lessons and tests. Although I already knew quite a lot of this material, I still really learned a lot about why certain methods work the way they do.I would have loved to get some sort of a certificate though.",5
9340,"Amazing course, amazing lectures!",5
9341,"I am a philology major student, and I can say that this course made me fall in love with mathematics from the very first lesson. It is easy to follow, the explanations are very clear, and the tests are doable even for those who have not solved a single maths problem in years (in this case one will probably need to refresh some basic things, but it will not take long, because many of the school basics are also explained in the beginning of the course). Thank you, Professor Fowler, for these wonderful 16 weeks of Calculus 1!",5
9342,Not enough material to understand the concepts.,1
9343,"Great course. Fun, engaging, Prof Fowler makes calculus feel easy even when teaching complex stuff, and has always a fun example or reference to cheer things up. If you are starting your calculus studies and you want to enjoy it rather than suffer, this is the course for you.",5
9344,it was tooo helpful for understanding calculus.,5
9345,very nice and easily accessible,5
9346,"Jim Fowler, PhD (the Lector) is awesome!",5
9347,interesting and useful,5
9348,Thank you so much for providing students with Calculus course.,5
9349,"The content of this course is fantastic, if you read the textbook with it. It would be 5 stars, but there are a number of glitches in the quizzes and exams. Information about the textbook and quiz issues can be found in the first post on the discussion board.",4
9350,he is the best calculus teacher I have ever meet,5
9351,simply amazing to refresh my 12th standard and masters concepts of calculus pratically,5
9352,I enjoyed this class very much. I found the material lucid and well presented. I enjoyed interacting with the other students and mentors in the discussion forum.,5
9353,"Nice teacher, nice subject!",5
9354,Awsom,5
9355,"Excellent course and very motivating teacher. I think more real life examples could be used, especialy in quizzes. Very compelling for begginers!",5
9356,"Not only does Jim Fowler teach new skills and knowledge he encourages students to think mathematically. But above it all, he enables learners to look at the familiar through new eyes.",5
9357,It´s great. I´m learning so much about of the Calculus. Thanks fot it.,5
9358,"great course, its been almost 20 years since i took calculus, now iam refreshening everything for the FE Exam, and this course has been awesome!!!! thanks",5
9359,Jim Fowler is pretty awesome prof. He teaches the course in pretty easy and exciting way.,5
9360,"That's great and fun class, it's worth to learn.",5
9361,"Dr Fowler is very enthusiastic, which is one of the most notable and best things about this course. Although some reviews complain that he over-explains things, I personally found this really helpful - you are taught not just how to do the calculations, but how they work fundamentally, which for me is a pretty important thing if I am to fully understand. The course is slightly above my level in some aspects, but I managed to pass with 100%, which I am very proud of! I'd say some basic knowledge of Calculus helps, but even if you are only just learning, I'd say this is set out in such a way that one could pick it up alright from this course. Only complaint is the sometimes glitchy quizzes, although the forums often say if there are any and how to get around them.Overall, I do recommend this course!",5
9362,"This class has taught me so much, just keep coming back to it because once I think I've figured something out I realize I didn't learn something else properly. I hope this class remains online and open all the time, it is very helpful to me because I was never really good at math in high school and I have decided to return to college after 10 years and I wish to earn a degree with a concentration and math because now that time has past ive lived a little and Im older I do see how advanced math is used in everyday life and I want to have a part in that. Thank you again for this class!",5
9363,This is truly a brilliant and amazing course. It is as fun the 10th time through as the first. I never tire of it! Seriously! It is about more than calculus. It is about mathematical thinking.,5
9364,"I'm taking this course as a refresher, and the prof is simply brilliant! Thanks for not making this a monotonous course. This is the teaching style we must adopt if we are to improve the way people learn more complicated subjects.Evolution of learning:Make it fun.Make it applicable.Eventually all these courses will be interactive and on tablets, but until then, let's teach courses like Jim.",5
9365,Wonderful opportunity to get to know calculus before I take it for credit at an engineering university.,5
9366,"amazing,good illustrations, good examples: )",5
9367,Incredibly Great!,5
9368,"Jim Fowler explains the complex concepts of calculus with impeccable clarity, resorting to analogies and graphs to help students grok the gist of each subject, rather than just memorising arid demonstrations (which the course also has, to a reasonable extent) or accept things just because. And on top of that, he's a lot of fun to listen to!",5
9369,"Very good course! the teacher is very enthusiastic and his english is easy to understand, even for persons whose english is not their mother tongue.",5
9370,"Jim Fowler has the ability to visualize complex concepts, make them easier to comprehend.He really made this course interesting. I'm very glad I took this course - it refreshes my memory also shows me learning is really fun.",5
9371,"Great Teachers, great content",5
9372,A fun filled yet insightful course with great illustrations. You'll love calculus by the time you are done with this! Amazing prof!,5
9373,"I really love this professor! From his teaching, I can see that math is his love and he devotes a lot to calculus! It's much better than that in my university, I must admit it.",5
9374,I took this class to catch back up before I resumed my degree. I have never been taught this class this way and I have studied under some fantastic professors before. This is hands down the best way to be taught this course.,5
9375,"Really frustrating method of teaching. Class is incredibly slow and does way, way too much simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication to prove extremely basic points for a calculus course.",1
9376,"This course is superb. Dr. Fowler does an excellent job of explaining both calculus concepts and the ""why"" behind them all. If you want to truly understand calculus, and not just be able to do the calculations, then this I highly recommend this course.",5
9377,Very passionate professor! Excellent course.,5
9378,"Very nice course, with a very nice teacher, I took this course twice.",5
9379,Excellent course for anyone who is looking to learn basics of calculus.,5
9380,This course is full of fun and joy!,5
9381,Great course! Everything is explained extremely clearly. The only 'missing star' here is that some of the final quizzes reject the correct answer due to a technical issue.,4
9382,"The professor spends LOTS of time doing really, really simple work -- over-explaining things, to be honest, in such a way that makes them more confusing. Then he does not explain much more complex issues throughout the course. Very frustrating, even as someone who has taken calculus before and is just taking this as a ""refresher.""",3
9383,"I have officially hit the halfway point of the course and am three weeks ahead of schedule. The last time I took a Calculus class was 17 years ago, during my Senior year of high school. It was the first time I ever got a B in Math, and ruined my love for the subject. Since then, I had all but abandoned my love for the subject because I thought I had a learning deficiency for Calculus. It turns out that my teacher was just sub-par, or leagues below Dr. Fowler. As someone who is strong with numbers, he is the perfect professor to bring out the conceptual learning student in me. The most impressive thing though is how he has delivered rules to me in an almost photographic format. After each lesson, which are all theoretical then provide graphical and numericalnexamples,I do one practice problem with what I absorbed and check the answer. It is normally incorrect, but after reading the correct answer and explanation I fly through the next five. Although I am sure that not having closed book graded quizes and more practice problems may subtract from his classroom course a bit, this is an amazing confidence booster and has propelled me nback on track!",5
9384,I really liked this course. Prof Jim Fowler explains the subject very well and his style made me really enthusiastic about maths. I am looking forward to starting Calculus Two. Thank you,5
9385,"This course is brilliant.The lectures are full of information, but they're also funny, engaging and always enjoyable. And there are loads of them (25 hrs?), so this feels like quite a thorough introduction to calculus.Some of the exercises are pretty tough for a newcomer like me, but the answers are always thoroughly explained. The lack of a hard time limit is very welcome because it gives you time to take in new ideas at your own pace, without rushing you through assignments or tests.What's more, it's all free. Hats off!",5
9386,I really love how the instructor motivates his class and makes everything easy to understand.,5
9387,"Solid course, I had some prior knowledge but still there were weeks that were new to me and that I didn't see before , teacher is doing its best to present material in fun way so I would recommend this course to refresh or get new knowledge in Calculus 1 area.",5
9388,"Loved this! The prof was very engaging and explained everything thoroughly, exactly the course I was looking for to learn Calculus!",5
9389,"I wanted the preview function on the quiz to be like ""scratch paper"".",4
9390,"The teacher teaches in a formal yet enjoyable manner. He is far better than any other teacher that I have ever seen, even in real life. He teaches with a balanced mix of enthusiasm and explanation. My only trouble during this course was being unable to log into mooculus.osu.edu.",5
9391,"It's a great course! I love MR. Fowler! He is so energetic :P And the concepts are presented in a realistic way ,easy to understand and easy to imagine.five stars :PI succeed in passing the course, I enjoyed it .Thanks to all the stuff involved !!! Best wishes.",5
9392,Best instructor in the world.,5
9393,"The teacher is very knowledgable, charismatic, and communicates the curriculum extremely well.",5
9394,"Perfect for Calculus beginers. But the homework can be more harder, it's too easy.",5
9395,it is very niice,4
9396,the guy that speaks is so passionate about what hes teaching!!!which makes it interesting and not boring,5
9397,Really thoughtful explanations of concepts that I have previously struggled with. Worth taking.,5
9398,"very good considering the amount of information conveyed in the short amount of time. A few of the tests were slightly glitchy in the acceptable range of correct answers (in terms of rounding answers) and would only accept things like 17*sqrt(15426) as the answer, even if an equivalent value down to the 6th decimal place was give instead.",4
9399,These are perfect lessons !!!,5
9400,"I feel that this is a great course for all levels of calculus students- those who have just taken up a calc course in high school, those who want to review calculus for higher studies or even those who want to learn calculus because they find it an interesting subject and want to gain more understanding of it. The instructor has put in a good amount of effort to explain not just the topics themselves but also to build up some level of conceptual understanding and insight, without delving too much in depth and keeping his lectures jargon-free. This has ensured that all learners are on the same level and can reap the benifits of learning calculus. Another take away from the coruse is that learners come to appreciate that calculus is both interesting as well as useful, a total contrast to the popular perception that it is confusing, boring and can be learned only rote learning of forumlas.",5
9401,"This is a great course, eventhough can be improved by having more subcific information.",5
9402,Great Course. Used it to review part of the math I had on University about 15 years ago.,5
9403,"Excellent courcse, aimed at understanding of concepts, not for cramming formulas in brain.",5
9404,"An excellent course and the best I have seen for calculus. It is very easy to understand and covers all topic and most importantly, it does so in a very short period of time. Thank you to the creator of this course.",5
9405,It's Simply The BEST!!,5
9406,It is the most hilarious course I have ever done online - and I mean the pleasure with learning. Not everyone can say the same about any maths course.Thank you for this wonderful course on Calculus.,5
9407,"The teacher Jim seems a very optimistic man. He is always happy. And the animation is just amazing, I never thought that the internet lesson could be so real and funny and successfully. Good luck.",5
9408,Jim Fowler is the Janis Joplin of mathematics. He transforms math into a never ending source of happiness.,5
9409,Fantastic teacher!,5
9410,The content is good. Needs better maintenance. Certain bugs and assignment errors should be rectified.,4
9411,"Jim have a special thing, he make me feel that happyness when I practice calculus, awesome teacher and excelent course, it is the same in my college. Thank you very much Jim. My calculus final grade was 4.19/5",5
9412,The proof can be more precise and specific.,4
9413,very good-course,5
9414,the video lectures are clear and very well done,5
9415,Taught very well; phenomenal teacher.,5
9416,Great,4
9417,It was too advanced for me,1
9418,Jim's enthusiasm is contagious.,5
9419,Great Teacher.Very simplified explanations on complex material.,5
9420,the teacher is awesome,5
9421,"Good course, everything well explained !",5
9422,"Great instructor, great lecture materials, best math class I've ever taken.",5
9423,This course is great. This guy has a way of really breaking down the subject and making it very easy to understand the concepts. Thank you very much for creating this course.,5
9424,"Very well organised, and it makes easy to understand difficult calculus topics.",5
9425,One of the best courses on Coursera. The material is presented in a very interesting way. You can get good skills in Calculus participating in this Course.,5
9426,"awesome professor and the classes are really helpful , thank you so much .please keep doing it , it means a lot to certain students like me who are actually facing difficulties understanding calculus .",5
9427,Hey. It's really perfect !The great thing in thin course is the professor.He is really good.i'm in the first of Intermediate Level in English and it means my English is not good enough but simple teaching of this professor really good and Be very good in English is not a must for learning.Thank U All !I'm Ali from Iran.,5
9428,"This course is extremely interesting. I found (and understood thanks to the simple and concrete explanations) so many things about maths that I didn't know. Nevertheless this cannot prepare you to take an exam at university (it's unthinkable to learn all about Calculus One in 10-minutes-videos!), but it can surely help you fill lacks on your knowledge of mathematics and fix many doubts. The professor is without any doubt really knowledgeable, and he knows how to increase interest in the audience. I can also say that his English is easily comprehensible (considering I'm not native English-speaker).Thanks for this course!",5
9429,Amazing Instructor !! Gives very good insights and relates the concepts holisticaly,5
9430,"I have never seen anybody who taught like Prof. Jim Fowler !!!!.Only he tells the ""WHY"" hidden behind every question.-Videos were FUN.-Practice Quizzes were making our understanding more clear about each topic.-End quizzes were extremely helpful.-Taking notes from his videos is ""WORTH"".THANK YOU",5
9431,The course has rekindled my passion for math!,5
9432,The teacher is so enthusiastic! This is a great course!,5
9433,the best teacher ever,5
9434,"Cool stuff along with fascinating teaching. Teacher's energetic manner deeply absorbs learner.Thanks a lot cause of this in my view ""masterpiece"".",5
9435,It helps me in all of my aspects in life and also makes me a more advanced and intelligent high schooler,5
9436,Great Course,5
9437,very clear explanation,5
9438,Great course! Everything is broken up into manageable pieces and the assignments are challenging. I'm up to week six and am learning a lot.,5
9439,Very fun way to mathematics..,5
9440,The best course i have ever seen!!!,5
9441,The lecturer is a naturally gifted teacher with seemingly limitless passion and enthusiasm for the course material. Freely downloadable textbook is also of very high quality. This course is a cut above the rest and should be examined by anyone designing a MOOC.,5
9442,Thanks,5
9443,The professor is funny and clear. The examples are easy to understand.,5
9444,"The professor is great at explaining things and seems REALLY enthusiastic about teaching calculus. I would've never thought any maths course could be so fun and easy to understand, especially when I'm only an eighth grader!!",5
9445,Excellent lecture videos and quizzes. Got a lot of help.,5
9446,"The teacher is Excellent. The materials used in teaching are very good.I liked the use of colors, the explanations in very details, and not skipping calculations. I liked the explanation behind everything, on how this is used in real life. I liked the enthusiasm of the teacher. He likes what he is doing and he loves Math.I think the limits subject should be taught in more details. I would liked it more if every theorem would have a proof. I think the use of epsilon/delta in practice was too little in this course, and should be expanded (it looks like this is a course for engineers rather than for mathematicians).The most painful problem in this course are the exercises, in 2 aspects.The first aspect: in many cases the exercises repeat themselves in a slightly different form - the diversity of of exercises should be expanded.The second aspect: exercises which require my typing have a lot of parsing issues, which are not clear, and are frustrating: example from integrals: the system would expect an answer like this one: (x)*(E^x) - E^x+C and would not accept a correct answer like this x*E^x - E^x+c. In this sense, I recommend using questions with multiple answers, and leave the open answers only for the cases where you need to type something where there are no parsing issues expected, such as typing numeric values.Thank you for this course.I liked it.",5
9447,I am simply enjoying this. Thank you Dr. Fowler for those wonderful teachings.,4
9448,I thought this was a well presented course with good coverage of the material. Only thing holding me back from giving it a five start rating is a few errors in the quizzes need to be fixed.,4
9449,This course is great for Grade 5's like me,5
9450,"Easy, fascinating and very common course based on the simple explanation of the instructors.",5
9451,never enjoied that much calculus,5
9452,good lessons but i cant manage time to listen . but now i decided to be punctual.,5
9453,straightforward and good pace with course material. this course really helps a lot in terms of preparations for more stats and calculus courses.,5
9454,Fun & effective teaching!,5

9461,It's awesome!!!,5
9462,Good intro to calculus that is not heavy on theory,5
9463,One of the best online and offline courses I have taken. Love the enthusiasm of the professor and focus on really understanding actual dynamics behind the formulas.,5
9464,I have just started but it looking real interesting so far.,4
9465,Great first year calculus course!,5
9466,Great materials,5
9467,"Great, very good teacher, in fact superb teacher. Outstanding explanations, easy to follow, very dynamic. I would like have had a teacher like this when in college. Recommend 100%.",5
9468,This was a very interesting course. I hadn't done any calculus for 40 years and it was wonderful to get back to it. I really enjoyed Jim's enthusiasm and the explanation of the fundamentals of calculus. . It would have been helpful to have the errors in the marking of quizzes corrected as they had been pointed out and acknowledged months ago.,5
9469,Excellent. I really enjoyed the presenter.,5
9470,"I always wanted to revisit my university course of Calculus. This course was the best refreshment I could have. All the lessons were great: limits, derivatives, integrals...Special thanks to Jim Fowler for the passion he puts when explaining the lessons",5
9471,The material is well presented and the instructors enthusiasm is really infectious. I did not finish calculus in college and this was a great way to revisit the material - and it is even presented so it makes sense! Very different from my first encounter with calculus. Thanks for producing the course!!,5
9472,"One of the well organized with best Teachers, best teaching methods, and easy to follow course.",5
9473,The teacher is great!,5
9474,"This course helped me excel in Calculus I my first semester of college. Calculus is a very difficult course, but the combination of an actual calculus class and this online class through coursera made a world of difference.",5
9475,lectures were really great,4
9476,"The teacher is greatThe course is funThe way I have to enter answers in quizes is boring, but doable.",5
9477,comprehensive and fun!,5
9478,"Excellent analogies and people skills, overall, by the instructor. Excellent for visual minds.",5
9479,Absolutely the best professor I have ever met. He is a god to me.,5
9480,This is a very good course; it help to remind the knowlodges about the introduction at the Calculus I.,5
9481,"Funny and entertaining, besides rigorous. It givess an intuitive understanding of all the formulas and a clear big picture of what calculus is all about.",5
9482,"it's a great professor,",5
9483,Jim Fowler is a great math professor!,5
9484,Very interesting,5
9485,Found what I missed in college life.,5
9486,Great introduction to calculus. Very clear explanations and good pace. Thoroughly enjoyable! Thank you!,5
9487,"Great instructor! Very clear and specific. It helps me a lot on calc one. I recommend it to those who are learning AP calc BC if you really want to skip the calculus in college. I did not do well in AP tests, so I took calc one this semester and it really helps me a lot.",5
9488,An excellent teacher and dynamics examples. Calculus becomes easier with this course!,5
9489,"Mr. Fowler has a very unique talent to explain complex things in a very simple way. I had A grades in mathematics through out school and university, but was never able to give such a practical definition of limits, derivatives and the rest of the foundational ideas. The best course on mathematics out there.",5
9490,"Great teachers, great explanations! Thank you!",5
9491,"I have never loved calculus as much, before. Fun, engaging and informative. Jim must be one of those teachers who can make any soporific topics fun.",5
9492,It's one of the greatest and funniest math courses I've ever got! Thank you so much for providing this great courses on-line!,5
9493,"The classes are very didactic, however the professor sometimes meanders too much and doesn't get to the point. Also, some of the the quizzes have little or nothing to do with the video lessons.",4
9494,Amazing teacher - must seen,5
9495,"This course is great. I have been in love with math since i was a child. But, I took an English Major at my campus. Though, it's been like forever since the last time i learned Math, I don't find it difficult to understand this course.",5
9496,I'm missing mathematical proofs.,3
9497,This teacher is great. Calculus was a problem for me. Now it's solving problems for me!,5
9498,"Superb course; it's helped me immensely in learning AP Calculus, and it's yet another reason for why Jim Fowler is such a highly acclaimed mathematician.",5
9499,Exceptional technique of teaching. Keeps you gripped and interested in it.,5
9500,"really informative, with a great teacher who is clearly passionate about his field of work",5
9501,Very useful!help me a lot,5

9503,Amazing Professor,5
9504,Excellent review of calculus!!,5
9505,"Energic lecturer. Love it! From how he teaches us, we can judge that he really loves calculus or maybe math in general is his passion.",4
9506,Great course and great teacher. Makes calculus seem very easy!,5
9507,This course is not good in giving lessons with examples that will help a with studying for the quizzes.,1
9508,This character was made for MOOC - his passionate energy is contagious and finally provides the excitement and awe that is Calculus!,5
9509,Superb! A very small but important thing that has grabbed my attention is the energy with which professor teaches. He tends to repeat very important concepts many times so as to make them permanent in the brains of students. 5+ stars. Keep it up. More than impressed.,5
9510,It's a greet course. The teacher show he's breathtaking way to help us to understand about calculus,5
9511,Great job，Great course,5
9512,"Great teacher, enthousiastic and energetic. Thanks very much",4
9513,"I absolutely LOVE this course. I've done calculus before and was taking this as a refresher course as I am planning to learn multivariable calculus. I feel like if Dr.Fowler taught the undergrad course in calc while I was in college, I would have enjoyed taking the class so much more. He explains concepts clearly, walks students through calculation steps thoroughly and, most importantly, is an enthusiastic lecturer. This is -- by far-- the best course I've ever taken on Coursera.com and I highly recommend it!",5
9514,I THINK THAT CALCULUS NEW WORLD IM MY LIFE...,5
9515,Extremely useful and as clear and explicit as possible.,5
9516,"Excellent course on calculus, Both the professors have done fabulous job.",5

9524,The teacher is so passionate it makes it easy to watch and learn :),5
9525,he is really can explain a profound theorie in simple language.,4
9526,My brain hurts.,5
9527,"This course is the only reason that I am currently flourishing in my college mathematics courses with 4.0s, but even more importantly, enjoying it. Prior to this, mathematics had always evoked a feeling of distress, but I now marvel in its ability to make us less intimidated by the universe's complexity and vastness, although it certainly does not answer every question. I almost feel guilty learning all of the things which took the whole human civilization thousands and thousands of years to contrive, and am humbled by the geniuses who had discovered all of the finite crucial mathematical theorems which ultimately gave way to an infinite amount of physical discoveries and insight, explaining ""the complex visible by some simple invisible"", as Jean Perrin once said.",5
9528,"I am taking this course together with my graduation calculus course, and this is pretty much better than all my classes, so far.Very good.",5
9529,It's easy to understand.,5
9530,Amazing course very helpful on my first semester! Thank you very much!!!,5
9531,Amazing course! Many thanks for all the effort that has been put into making this. I have loved taking this course and am looking forward to taking calculus two!,5
9532,Loving it so far,5
9533,"Great thank to Jim Fowler and the rest disagners of this course for outstanding course! 1 this course discovered calculus better than a year of Calculus in my university (allthough it wasn't mathematition university, topics was same as on the course).",5
9534,Great Teacher with clear examples and presentations !,4
9535,That's great!,5
9536,The instructor has a communicative enthusiasm !,5
9537,"i love the teacher, his way of teaching, also, hes very energetic, dynamic and passionate.",5

9540,I cant wait to start,5
9541,"Professor Jim Fowler is amazing: great scientist with 'this' sense of humor that inspires me to study math more,more, more...",5
9542,"Five stars, even though there were some errors in the quizes and inconsistencies of parsing E/e. But that's a minor issue when you have such an amazing lectures in the course. I've praised Jim for Calculus Two and I praise him again for this course. Superb instructor, the best I've seen thus far after working on tens of Math/CS MOOCs. I wish there were more courses from him, a really gifted teacher and amazing mathematician.",5
9543,The teacher is great and the course is even better.,5
9544,One of the best Mathematics course that I have seen. Prof. Jim Fowler is awesome.,5

9546,I am in the course currently. Very nicely done with a most enthusiastic instructor.,5
9547,"The best math course ever! Finally, I find out all my issues which I wanted to know.",5
9548,good.explains the lessons so simply and with a lot of examples so we can learn better.,5
9549,I love this course!,5
9550,"I did calculus in my final year of school, and a couple of years later I've realised I'm actually going to need this calculus. This course not only got me back to the level l was at when I finished school, but it gave me a much better understanding of the fundamental concepts and processes behind everything I had once upon a time learned, which gave me a much better understanding.",5
9551,"A very funn course, for the way the professor brings the material, without turning the subject a havy stuff, as it usaually turns out to be with mathematics.",4
9552,The professor is very easy to follow and makes a subject that is constantly deemed as dry much more interesting. I can't wait to learn more.,5
9553,This course is just amazing! But it could have been a little short!,4
9554,"almost finish the 2nd week ! already fall in love with calculus One, refreshes my calculus mind :)",5
9555,The way Prof. Fowler explained the concepts and the energy he put in teaching is commendable.I got confident in calculus I after learning this course.,5
9556,"Has a bit too many errors in the questions, and there's no proper introduction to new signs.",4
9557,"Brilliant work you got there........................Keep doing what you are doing i.e.,exploring...........",5
9558,The course is just awesome. What makes this course so good is the enthusiasm with which professor Jim teaches this course. Brilliant! !!,5
9559,"Such a nice class.However, it does not cover some subjects in ap calculus bc",5
9560,Very well taught course with lots of hands on work.,5
9561,Very well structured!,5
9562,The instructor is awesome - think if Bill Nye and Bob Ross got together to teach calculus. Loved it.,5
9563,he is cute～,5
9564,"The teacher is very energetic and good speaker. I can see that he worked a lot for this course. Videos have very good details(graphical effects, prepared papers for lesson). He teaches very clearly, i am understanding all the subject despite i am bad at English.",5
9565,"Prof Fowler has a really effective and engaging method of presenting the course in an accessible manner. The visual aids are used to good effect to illustrate each topic, whilst the module tests really help to cement the knowledge, occasionally boosted by being able to re-watch the relevant lecture should there be any sticking points.",5
9566,"Outstanding.The instructor has a _great_ and rare skill: He is able to make calculus easier, interesting and fun. It's a pleasure to watch these lessons and listen to the instructor.I had other calculus classes in past (now I want to refresh my knowledge) and they leaded me to consider calculus boring, not so interesting, and sometime difficult. This course convinced me that I was _completely_ wrong! Now I'm looking forward to watch the next lesson!So far, I really have to recommend this course to everyone. Don't miss it!",5
9567,Great course content. Great professor. What more could you ask for?,5
9568,It was a great opportunity. Thank you very much,5
9569,"This course is simply AWESOME. Prof. Fowler's explanations are great, but probably you know it won't do its job unless you really dedicate some effort on your own.Calculus is a pretty complex and intimidating subject but not an impossible one. Do as many exercises as you can. Play with it and keep your enthusiasm like Prof. Fowler. Understanding will be your reward.",5
9570,"Fantastic work, thank you!",5
9571,awesome teaching !!,5
9572,I am studying engineering and I wanted to study calculus before I had this discipline in the college. It is helping me a lot so far.,5
9573,"This is actually good. the tutor is very fun and it makes me feel clearly about calculus. But, it will be more excellent if this course give a short quiz for each topic in end of the section. And for the final test, can this course give more test? I mean like more question in number or kind of test.",3
9574,Really good course materials and really effective explanations on topics relative to Caculus. However may not be very effective for people who haven't yet graduated from high school mathematics.,5
9575,Great way to introduce Calculus to everyone!,5
9576,It's an really amazing course. The teacher made every formular a lot more easier to understand. :) Thanks Tim!,5
9577,The lecturer was really great and was able to explain things enthusiastically and simply. Unfortunately I feel the level of the course is too low. I think the basis of calculus has to come from rigorous definitions of the concepts involved and firm understanding of the proofs. Hopefully I will get some of that in your Calculus Two course.,3
9578,There were and still are some typos in tests.,3
9579,got the job done,3
9580,Thank you Jim. You finally helped me understand the applications behind calculus and you did it in a fun way. Hope to see more courses from you on Coursera!,5
9581,this is awesome course.,5
9582,The instructor is great that make me to enjoy the Math. I never think Math can be so fun. Thanks so much.,5
9583,"The explanations are direct, simple and exact! The exercises are the reflection of the classes! The teacher is espectacular! Congrats to the team!",5
9584,"I'm loving the course so far! I'm only in week 2 though, so I'll let you know in week 7 or 8 if I can",5
9585,Excellent!Read the book with the lectures.Inspirational. Thought provoking. Informative. Challenging.Enjoy :)Jeremy K,5
9586,"There're some errors in subtitle, around the Integrals Weeks",4
9587,"It was a really fun course; I have started to understand how the power rule, etc can be used to differentiate functions and also learning new methods to integrate (Riemann Sum) and differentiate! Sadly, I wish there were extra questions that you could attempt to consolidate your knowledge!",5
9588,easy，but very interesting！！,5
9589,this course is very communicative and inspirative,5
9590,it is 'the' course for foundation of Calculus!,5
9591,"The course is very well presented and the lecturer's explanation is very clear.Thanks to this course, and the lecturer's enthusiam and passion, I have gain a good appreciation of the subject.",5
9592,Awesome. I have enjoy very much this course.,5
9593,Covers all the information needed for a basic calculus course. All the videos were understood and it encourages the student to learn and keep learning while enjoying it. One of the best courses I've taken so far.,5
9594,With it Calculus is easy! Could have more creative homework though...,5
9595,I recommend you this course. This course is very nice.Lectures are very easy to understand even if you are first time of calculus.But I think the questions are too little to exercise enough.Anyway thanks for the instructor. He's very nice and passionate guy.,5
9596,"Some of the contents just seem overly complex, especially the videos. If they would do a few problems similar to those in the quizzes, it would be much more better.",3
9597,Awesome tutorial.,5
9598,"Not only the contents but also how it is presented. Jim Fowler, PhD, presents the content of this course with so much enthousiasm. A very nice example of how teaching calculus, mathematics or any course/module at any educational institution should be done.",5
9599,Really good explanation.Great teacher,5
9600,"Pretty neat course for filling in gaps left by your education system in teaching you, probably the most important of all mathematical concepts, CALCULUS. J. Fowler does a great job of explaining things clearly and is pretty neat, overall. Highly recommended!",4
9601,Perfect!,5
9602,The teacher is just awesome! I love this! Thanks alot for making this available for everyone for free! I really appreciate it!,5
9603,This is an awesome course,5
9604,The best course so far,5
9605,Very clear explanations. Funny content. And the most important:Challenging!,5
9606,best math class ever,5
9607,"Awesome, in depth, just the quizzes seem a bit difficult to comprehend.",5
9608,The professor is awesome and explains everything very clearly. I think I can even fall in love with math after this course :),5
9609,"Thanks so much, teacher!!!!You are the BEST!!!!!",5
9610,Top notch .,5
9611,Learning is intelligent and differente. Good work teacher.,5
9612,Wow! It's just AWESOME :),5
9613,Very well explained and easy to understand. Some concepts that I missed in college got cleared....,5
9614,"Excellent course, far better than any I have encountered previously. The course takes time, but Jim Fowler shows step by step how the derivation and integration fit together in one whole: calculus. Relevant theorems and proofs are highlighted clearly.",5
9615,I wanted to go back a relearn some calculus long ago. I can't say enough good about this course. I love the professor's passion for his subject - always a mark of a great teacher. He breaks big subjects into small pieces for easy ingestion.,5
9616,"I have always loved math and I always will, but I enjoy this class because at times when I doubt my love of math, this class somehow reassures me.",5
9617,The course will make you love mathematics!,5
9618,Extremely enthusiastic teacher with an intense passion for what he teaches. Makes calculus interesting and more than palatable.,5
9619,"I came here curious about the chain rule (in connection with computing gradients for neural networks back-propagation) and to brush up calculus so I could help my high schooler kid. I ended up relearning lots of old skills as well as some techniques that I didn't remember (or didn't learn well enough back in high school). Prof Fowler is very engaging and a great teacher. I found his attempts to prove the same idea from multiple viewpoints very interesting. The self-paced setup of the course is also quite helpful, and the mandatory exercises at the end of each section help to reinforce the material. So great course and a great implementation!",5
9620,This course is very impressive to me. I get many experiences in answering the questions. Thanks,5
9621,"Pretty great, must say. The teacher is enthusiastic and quirky while knowledgeable and learnt.",4
9622,"Great teacher, good material. It's awesome for those who want to become familiar with calculus.",5
9623,Many thanks to Jim Fowler for the excellent course!,5
9624,Perfect way to remind university Calculus program.,5
9625,"It is a good course, but the quiz/exercises are very difficult, and sometimes, unrelated to the topics",3
9626,This course is great! Deep and very clear!,5
9627,"The professor is very motivated, teaches very well, uses different (including visual) ways to explain the content.The course is very detailed, but does not goes fast. So this is easy to get it done.",5
9628,"The course is really good, because the teacher is great, but there are some errors in subtitles, and even in some exercises.",4
9629,Easy to understand and the teacher is cool,5
9630,I already took Calculus 1 before and now tutor in it - and this course makes me feel like I'm seeing things in a new light. Jim Fowler is amazing!,5
9631,Professor Fowler is a wonderful teacher. I am very glad I signed up for this course on Coursera.,5
9632,Exceptional and Unique Style of Teaching!,4
9633,"Brilliant professor, brilliant course!",5
9634,Love the instructor. You won't find a college Calc 1 class with a more engaging prof.,5
9635,"Great Professor. Made the subject simple, like adding two numbers.",5
9636,This course was helpful for me. I learned some basic things. Thanks Sir. :),4
9637,Finally I can understand calculus.,5
9638,Awesome course!,5
9639,It's a great course with an amazing teacher.,5
9640,"Thank you ,i have learned a lot from this course, and this teacher is my favourate teacher.",5
9641,"Best way to learn basic univariable calculus there is. Jim Fowler explains everything incredibly clearly showing all the proofs, the intuitive evidence needed. This course is how I went from a maths-idiot to a maths genius in a couple short months.",5
9642,awesome tutor!!,5
9643,"Great course, loving the energy so far!",5
9644,"Jim Fowler is a wonderfull teacher and this course explain theorem not like school does. An awesome way to learn and to remember what you've learned. His motivation and dynamism is contagious ! I think the message is ""Use your god damn intuition !"".Thanks a lot.",5
9645,"There is some good material in this course. The text is fairly good. But I have two main reservations about the course. The first is that the lectures do not always correspond closely enough with the quizzes, and with the text. There are times when one can take a quiz and think, ""How exactly does this relate to the lectures I just saw?"" The text has quite a few exercises, but there is a tendency to throw in one or two problems whose difficulty is an order of magnitude above everything else in that section, and I find this discouraging and a waste of time. Save those for a later course, or put them into a separate ""Extra Challenges"" section. Learning calculus is hard enough without trying to grapple without some really tricky trig problem at the same time. as a single example.The second reservation is with the instructor's manner. Many students find it very enjoyable. I am not one of them. Much of the time, he's OK, especially when the camera is not pointed at him. But as the course progresses, much of the footage is of him at his desk, and the closeups become more and more extreme, the hand-waving and fist-clenching approach sheer windmilling, and the exaggerated eye-rolling, grinning and so forth become so distracting that I can't bear to watch. I realize that the goal was to avoid being a dry-as-dust droning professor, and that is commendable, but there is a happy middle ground between that and hamming. I can almost speculate that there was an impulse to add in cartoon sproing-bonk-cuckoo-klaxon sound effects. (There is actually one such sound effect, but just one, so I won't quibble on that.)I would have found the class more effective with a demeanor that was enthusiastic without being histrionic. I'm sure this is one of those ""you either love it or hate it"" things, and I may be in the minority.The instructor is not generally one to throw out some concept that has not already been learned and then just motor on without explanation. He errs on the side of overly-detailed explanation, which to me is preferable to skipping over subjects or techniques and assuming you know them.Having said all of this, I repeat that there is good material, and you can learn the fundamentals of calculus for free in this course.",3
9646,A course that changed my life and my attitude to mathematics.,5
9647,Till now this is the best explanation i've come accross for the limits and functions,5
9648,"This is an online course that is designed as an online course. It is not just a recorded classroom lecture. It is an excellent math course, and an excellent example of developing and experimenting with new means of teaching and communication. One of the best MOOCs out there.",5
9649,"Great content, thanks.",5
9650,Did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but had it on the first quiz,1
9651,Was able to reach our imagination. Great transmission skills.,5
9652,Love the way Jim teaches. It's easy to understand and grasp the big picture of calculus! I love it!,5
9653,"A great refresher to the calculus from high school, and then some.",5
9654,"A very useful course.Although I studied calculus before , this course was a good revision and helpful in gaining insight. This course is not only about applying formulas, but also understanding them.Recommended for anyone who wants to start studying calculus.",5
9655,"Very impressive, comprehensible and exhaustive course! Thanks a lot for a possibility to review and study such an important part of math. Indeed, very interesting.",5
9656,"The instructor is phenomenal - the material is clear, engaging and even entertaining. I am having a blast, ergo I am learning.Thanks a lot!",5
9657,"Excellent Course. Good professor and good exercisses. Good job, Professor.",5
9658,It maybe early to say since I am just mid way week 1 but so far it has been great. Thank You Coursera,4
9659,"Love it. Very in depth and detailed. One of the best for college students I've found. Others go randomly from one topic to the next without showing any real, necessary application.",5
9660,the professor is amazing.,4
9661,excellent material delivered in a simple way,5
9662,Thank you professor Jim Fowler! You make Calculus seems easy as pie.,5
9663,superb course especially for beginners.....,5
9664,"Entertaining, maths the fun way.",5
9665,"I thought the professor was really great about explaining things in a clear, concise manner. I think some of the quiz problems were more complicated than they needed to be, especially considering that typing in a long string you're very likely to have a typo which results in missing a question you knew how to do.",4
9666,so much use full for everyone.,5
9667,A great course :),5
9668,Brilliant! Best course and first of all best teacher ever! Thank you for what I learned and how easy and interesting that was!,5
9669,Excellent videos! The course is well-paced and thorough. Explanations and example problems are worked out in detail. This is one of the best on-line course presentations I have seen--and I have taken many online courses and MOOCs for both degree and non-degree study.,5
9670,incredible :) It makes me feel the amazement of Calculus,4
9671,"I haven't finished all of the material yet, but this is a fantastic course. Needed a refresher on single variable and managed to learn a couple of things I missed in high school.",5
9672,"Perfection it’s not a “real” thing, it’s an “idea”. Perhaps, it’s just like a “Limit”. This Calculus Course is not “perfect”, but can leave you as close to that limit as you want to be.",5
9673,Like the way you teach so much! :) thank you and waiting for your new courses!,5
9674,Fun learning and the course is set up so you actually learn the concepts and not just how to regurgitate information.,5
9675,interestingusefulthanks,5
9676,Good teacher,5
9677,I lost all my love of math while in college. This helped me take up interest in math again. I'm also using the material in this course to prepare for a masters in Mathematics.,5
9678,"Awesome teaching style. I must say, ""This course saves me in mathematics"" or ""Re-inducts passion of mathematic""",5
9679,Great explanations by the course guide.,5
9680,Perfect Class,5
9681,This teacher is awesome :),5
9682,The instructor has a unique way of presenting calculus that simultaneously makes it both interesting and clear. The only part of the class that was very frustrating is figuring out how to input answers to get them acceptable to the computer grader.,5
9683,really easy to understand. :),5
9684,Ones of the best the professor is just amazing!!!,5
9685,So far the professor is the most engaging math professor I have ever had. Very easy to follow the examples.,5
9686,One of the best courses I've completed on Coursera.,5
9687,"interesting and comprehensible, very enthusiastic teacher!",5
9688,"This is the course that I'm taking for right now before closing time for math assignments for me. I know Calculus is a large subject with all new topics dividing into modules. The Calculus 1 will be included functions, limits, infinities, derivatives, and area and integrals. I will just do my best as I can in order to try Calculus; it's going to be tough for me to listen. There's a lot of stuffs going on in Calculus.",4
9689,"thanks , good challenge",4
9690,The teacher is so cute!!! And this course is really insteresting and useful.,5
9691,I like this course full of details.Thanks :),4
9692,The instructor is phenomenal. He really knows how to demonstrate the concepts well.,5
9693,Jim Fowler is a fantastic explainer,5
9694,Nothing is making sense. None of the videos are related to the quiz. None of the examples are remotely related to the quiz to even give you a suggestion on how to solve them.,1
9695,A fun way to get reintroduced to what once was boring calculus.,5
9696,looking forward your calculus 2 :),5
9697,Very good course. The lecturer was amazing!!!! The best Math lecturer,5
9698,"Awesome instructor, visualization, concepts and materials!!!",5
9699,Amazing course and wonderful teacher! I wish I had done this course before I entered university. Greeetings from Belarus! Thanks a lot!,5
9700,The Doctor speaks so funny!Look at his eyes!!HahahahahahaLoL!!,5
9701,I Loovvveee This Class :),5
9702,"too easy,not fit me",3
9703,"I Love it, the instructor is amazing. He explains everything so clearly, i dont even need the subtittles, who needs subtittles.",5
9704,I love the instructors enthusiasm. Its extremely motivating!,5
9705,Professor has AMAZING energy...just a solid class and perfect if you need a refresher.,5
9706,This is a beautiful course about Calculus.,4
9707,"Course is really cool, though, there is some as for forms of Answers, e^x or E^x for instance, if fixed, it would get 5 stars",4
9708,"This course is amazing! I used it to study Calculus, all the videos are self-explanatory and the excersizes are a fun way of checking what one has learnt. One should have a working understanding of algebra though.",5
9709,"A total waste of time -- not challenging at all in any aspect. It was quite funny that many word problems were identical with only some parameters changing :) Buckeyes... please, try harder next time :)",1
9710,"It is a complete course, with visualization and with silent demonstrations accompanying explanations. I like very much the videos and the exercises.",5
9711,"This course requires really hard work, although it is worth taking and doing. The instructor is very enthusiastic, which makes me love engaging with this course.",5
9712,Your teaching skills are brilliant. I really satisfied from materials and undoubtedly I try to get every course who you are teacher.,5
9713,Inspiring lecturer!,5
9714,It's a funny and fascinating course,5
9715,"The dynamics of the lectures, coupled with Jim's humour and his capacity of explain concepts in a simple way, makes the Excellence of this course. Hopefully we can continue through Calculus 2, 3 and 4.",5
9716,Nice Explanations by the Instructors.,5
9717,Excellent course and brilliant teacher! The best way to learn calculus basics for non mathematicians.,5
9718,Fantastic teacher who teaches concepts simply and with passion.,5
9719,Excellent Course. Jim Fowler is fantastic tutor....,5
9720,"i like this kind of class, it makes Calculus attractive charmin",5
9721,Great course! The professor puts a lot of passion in the lectures. Strongly suggested for anyone interested in calculus. I just hope that some little errors in the tests will be corrected.,5
9722,Excellent!Extremely recommended to all interested in learning calculus.The teacher and the teaching tools are great.,5
9723,It's a great course. Some of the points touched go beyond just the theory and are made so profoundly by the professor that you start looking at few concepts in a different light.,5
9724,"Lively, and more practial",4
9725,this course is very good for understanding Calculusif you don't believe just give it a try!,5
9726,This course is awesome... Simply enjoying the enthusiasm of dr. Jim Fowler.... Thank you...,5
9727,Some parts of the course were either not well explained or too rudimentary in relation to the quizzes.,4
9728,"I like this course, the professor has explained problems clearly and orderly! I like the way he teaches. Many thanks!",5
9729,Very good course to brush up Calculus,5
9730,"Brilliant course! Easy to follow, well-constructed - Jim is thorough and clear in explaining quite complex material. Even if you are new to calculus I would recommend this course. I'm doing his second one now whcih is even better.",5
9731,"Excellent lectures, and funny, too! I enjoyed this course. There is some problem with some quiz answers that should be fixed.",4
9732,Excellent Course. Recommend all mathematics lovers to take this course. Prof Jim Fowler is absolutely amazing. Thank you Jim and Coursera for putting together this amazing learning experience.,5
9733,would be 5 star if it gave certificates,4
9734,Started with almost zero in Calculus and deeply immersed with professor's passion in math,5
9735,The class is great and novel.And Mr.Fowler is very funny.I like the class very much.,5
9736,Prof Fowler is the most engaging math teacher of all time!,5
9737,Dr.Fowler is my best math teacher ever!,5
9738,Great introductory course!,4
9739,"Lot of typos and glitches, as well as typing in equations being really difficult",2
9740,Perfect!,5
9741,best course i ever had .professor was just perfect nothing could be pleasing than seeing his overly happy face.good luck sir !! we all student really appreciate for your efforts .,5
9742,get new material - new videos these videos for all your classes are years old - the quizes dont relate to the material taught and it seems you guys got this set up years ago and just forgot about it,2
9743,The perfect companion for learning calculus!,5
9744,"Great course, although at times I had problems with figuring out how to enter my solution into the answer box.",5
9745,"The explanation of each topic is awesome.I used to find calculus to much to remember. After signing up for this course, I keep coming back to learn more :)Very nicely explained each topic",5
9746,This course is very awesome. Professor's unconventional way of explaining the concepts really helped me learn some of the tough concepts. I really enjoyed Calculus for the first time :),5
9747,"Excellent teaching methodology ! I really like the enthusiasm of the instructor Dr. Jim Fowler.Although I had prior experience with calculus, this course has helped clear some of the basics and made me look at Calculus from a totally different perspective.Thanks to Coursera & The OSU for developing this exciting course ! I highly recommend it .",5
9748,"I think this is really best course on courseera, teacher is just amazing, he is explaining very clearly and with good humor",5
9749,"Very passionate professor,",5
9750,This course has been a great source to revise and learn calculus. The textbook and the course quizzes have added great value to the course. Thanks to Dr. Fowler and his team for providing a very good course. It would be great if they could come back with a course for multi-variable calculus.,5
9751,"That was awesome! This course was exactly what I needed, It gives me insight into Calculus. I love the effort instructor puts in and his creativity to explain terms. I am gonna take Second part of the course too. Peace",5
9752,It's a very good course.,5
9753,Every concept is taught excellently by providing examples. Just loved it!!,5
9754,"The best math course online. The format is great, and professor Fowler is a terrific teacher.",5
9755,"I enjoyed it. Jim Fowler does well, his enthusiasm and the time and effort he (and whatever filming and editing team he has) have put into the presentation is impressive. Difficult for me to rate it as a maths course - how would I know whether it covers what it needs and have anything meaningful to stay about the standard of it. I felt I understood what was going on, I passed the quizzes. Maybe that's all good?Occasional bug in the quizes - nothing you can't work around (eg totally blank question but four answers to choose from.) The mathematical symbol rendering doesn't work on the mobile app at all.",4
9756,"The course assumes no prior knowledge of calculus. The video lectures and explanations provided by Professor Jim Fowler on all of the topics in the course are excellent. There is quite a lot of work in the course overall, and it does require some perseverance to get through it. However, it does allow you to work at your own pace which is a welcome feature for a beginning learner in calculus. As well as providing a thorough explanation of the usual processes involved in differentiation and integration, the course shows many techniques that are not well explained in text books. From a personal perspective, the course took me about 6 months to complete and I learnt a lot by doing it. Many thanks to Professor Fowler for his teaching and insights into calculus.",5
9757,It's fun,5
9758,Clear and fun.,5
9759,It is unarguably among the most amazing courses with a great instructor. I took this course to brush up on Calculus and I think it delivered way more than my expectations.,5
9760,"This course is amazing, I really learned a lot about calculus. Teacher is great!",5
9761,Fowler is the man Keep on! Wonderful!,5
9762,it's great and i knew what is calculus rather than doing thousands of problems i do frequently,5
9763,awesome teacher!,5
9764,"Fun refresher for someone that took Calculus 30 years ago. Great lectures and examples. Quiz answers don't always use the proper ""upper case E"" for e correctly, so be prepared to be marked down for correct answers sometimes (but you can ""correct"" your answers on retake). It would be great to get this fixed!",4
9765,Excellent course. Jim Fowler is a wizard!,5
9766,The instructor is awesome. One of the best in coursera...,5
9767,"Amazing Calculus course, helped me a lot.",5
9768,The instructional videos were very helpful. I've learned a lot from this course!,5
9769,C,4
9770,Really challenging. Great course!!,5
9771,This course is an excellent brain exercise.,5
9772,"My least favorite course in the specialization. The lectures are harder to follow, and are actually all about bioinformatics algorithms, which wasn't clear from the course description. Thankfully, as with the graphs course, Michael Levin wades in to save the day for the last couple of weeks. His lectures are really well structured, intuitive and clear.",3
9773,"Another great course! I am a little sad since it was only 4 weeks long when the rest were about 5 weeks each. I feel like there may have been another topic (regular expressions?) that could have been covered but these are still great and now I see how we can do string matching in things like text editors and do them in O(n) time. Wonderful series, I've certainly grown a lot in just these past 4 online courses, keep up the great work! My advice to people taking these courses, be prepared to put time and really think about what you're doing. Try applying the things here to things you see in real life and you'll find they have much more relevance. Cheers and good luck!",5
9774,I think last week was too complex and not that exciting.,3
9775,"Good contents, but lectures could be improved for clarity.",3
9776,The excercises should be set up to be more comfortable.,2
9777,"Some tasks was hard to understand and solve, but it in general it was good.",4
9778,"The course contents we useful and easy to learn for the most part. The assignments and spot quizzes helped a lot to understand the string algorithms. I appreciate all the effort the instructors put to create the course materials.Few things to improve:1) Some of videos in week3 and 4 were hard to understand due to English speaking skills. I found a lot of grammar mistakes in the subtitles and the interactive transcripts.2) Please consider adding more contents like Boyer Moore algorithm, regular expression and etc.",4
9779,"Initially the accent was a little bit hard to understand, but after few minutes everything become crystal clear. Extremely useful course content.",4
9780,I really enjoyed this course,5
9781,I would recommend this part to anyone who wants to learn string algorithms. Thanks for the course!,5
9782,Very focused on bioinformatics problems.,4
9783,"I have only one feedback: the relation between subsequent weeks are not clear. It feels like I am learning one technique in week 3, and then another in week 4, but why is the technique in week 4 necessary? What are the differences in terms of functionality, between the various techniques? I think these points are not explained quite clearly.Great course though, thank you very much!",4
9784,"Quite an interesting and well-organised course, giving a detailed overview of the pattern matching problem and solutions for it (on the other hand, if you are expecting to see a wide variety of string problems, the course title is misleading).Assignments and quizes are also likeable (although the pseudocodes in the slides and the code skeletons for the solutions contain quite a number of mistakes).",4
9785,It would be nice if you could deliver the problem's solutions after the course ended. I ran out of ideas for the BetterBWMatching problem and i couldn't overcome the time issues.,4
9786,"This course is not precisely bad, but it's very lacking compared to the other courses in the specialization. Here are my complaints:-Much of the more interesting bits say ""check out this other course in bioinformatics for details"". Of course, if you aren't registered for that other course, you don't have access to those materials.-Not a lot of thought went into the homeworks. All of them are ""implement this. Here is some pseudocode"", with no ""think about a problem that can be solved with the same ideas"", like the other courses in the specialization (which are, in my opinion, much better).-We saw 4 algorithms for string matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp, suffix array matching, Burrow-Wheeler's transform), but virtually no discussion on when to use each one, strengths and weaknesses, and so on. Also, no Boyer-Moore?-After passing all test cases for a homework, we should be able to download a solution with the correct implementation, in order to improve our own.",2
9787,"too complex, and I don't think in the future work I will apply these.",4
9788,Very difficult test programs,3
9789,"Very good course. I learned a lot. The most important part is the assignment. I have not watched all the videos, but checked it only when I am stuck at the programming assignment and the slides are not enough to understand.",5
9790,"The lecture was very abstract and difficult. I could pass the course somehow by writing the code presented in the lecture, but I must say I understand less than the half of the course contents.###Responding to question from the instructor, I clarify the comments above.I found the whole lecture difficult. This may be because the subject is not something I have even thought about. It was difficult to understand the difference and importance of key concepts such as trie, suffix, class, etc. Overall, I learned that the tricks somehow work, but my comprehension was not as deep as I can think about the extension or applications. I guess more examples or providing intuition would help me to digest the material.",3
9791,This is an interesting and useful but a bit difficult course.,5
9792,Excellent for working on string related problems in competetive coding as well as development profiles.,5
9793,"Still stuck at Problem 5 of Week 1, had to left this problem undone.Wondering if the mentors or professors can send those who completed the course the standard/reference solution/program via Email???",4
9794,"Difficulty level increased a bit compared to first 3 courses, be prepared!",5
9795,Course Content is good. Instructors are not that much active to give answers for the raised questions compared to earlier courses.,4
9796,"Great Course, assignment a little bit harder than previous courses in the specialization",5
9797,Good course!,5
9798,"Excellent course, properly designed and well presented...",5
9799,It's better to watch the Youtube videos to understand the concepts.,1
9800,"Nice introduction into string algorithms, even though Ukkonen's algorithm is missing and slides sometimes contain buggy pseudocode.",4
9801,Really good quality information and examples (includes reasoning). It includes some of the latest developments in this area.,5
9802,The lectures are a little bit confused,4
9803,this course is awesome!,5
9804,This course has wonderful algorithms,5
9805,"This class makes string algorithms a very interesting and enjoyable topic, and if you are interested in improving your algorithmic knowledge, I would highly suggest taking this course.The first algorithms you will learn are motivated by problems from Bioinformatics (genome sequencing), and new interesting problems arise and get solved on the way.All the material is very well explained so you can really understand why it works and not only how (there are even some very enjoyable proofs here)! The programming assignments (there are a lot of them) give you a hands-on experience implementing the different algorithms. This greatly improves the understanding and is therefore a crucial aspect of this class.",5
9806,GOD BLESS! AMAZING COURSE! THANK YOU!,5
9807,"you have to let us know in the beginning of the course, that we have to pay for finish the course!!!",3
9808,"Test errors, no answers from staff on forums, poor narration at times, audio scripts that do not quite correspond to what is being said... It needs careful reviewing and more user-friendly features being introduced by the organisers.",2
9809,is an interesting cours....,5
9810,Loved the course. Learned a lot. Totally worth it.,5
9811,"A great class, a great professor",5
9812,"First to congratulate the teacher, who impresses the class with a unique dynamism and uses tools so that history to be narrated so brilliantly, enters the body and is impregnated every neuron about information, which becomes a part of your life , Since that structure becomes a film that is narrating a history as a whole, that of Rome and that of the Jewish people.",5
9813,Very disappointing course. Far too much repetition. A lot of opinion based on scant evidence. It would have been much better as a 30 minute video without all the fluff and unsubstantiated inferences. I would not recommend this course.,1
9814,"I think, I can understand, the more and less of living rooted in a common history. The description of life with the elegies and sorrows can be seen in the panel of the Arch of Titus. The most important teaching is positivism in the face of difficult facts and the capacity of the human being to give a different meaning to adversities.",5
9815,I rate this course as excellent. It was fascinating and I enjoyed the detailed study. I also enjoyed the beautiful filming of the various locations and especially the Arch of Titus itself,5
9816,"I didn't really feel that there was enough material here to make a six-week course, so that there was a great deal of repetition, and very little context of the Roman period.",3
9817,"This wasn't quite what I expected. A lot of the ""lectures"" were very repetitive, which was annoying. However, I learned a lot and enjoyed the assignments. The Arch of Titus Project sounds really interesting and I'm looking forward to their next findings!",4
9818,Historically the basic background have been discussed. Effort was to make it nationalistic and emotional.Significance of Menorah as a symbol is absolutely missing. All the emphasis was on the Arch but the Arch looses its very significance without the menorah. So this should be covered or shared properly. For example Questions like why 7 hands needs to be replied. Why 3 legs needs to be repliedWhy painting ? This learning was not supposed to be in it. Someone might or might not like painting as a concept to learn and the course title also gave no indication towards that.. Wrong to make it a mandatory part as an assignment.,3
9819,"Interesting and inciteful. Dr. Fine is an excellent instructor! Thank you, sir. I hope you will present more classes from Yeshiva University!",5
9820,"I really enjoyed this course. It both further my reading and knowledge in some areas, while introducing new topics to me that I'd not yet encountered.My only problem was with the final assignment - it does not do justice to the topic of the final week, which is the issue of colour on ancient monuments (in particular the arch, of course) and the implications of colour on composition and on later perceptions of antiquity. The assignment itself did not give me an opportunity to really explore these issues.",4
9821,"The last assignment is a time-waster and really poorly designed. Not all adults are into coloring; this is not elementary school and what's the point of coloring a picture of the Arch for you? Frankly I can't be bothered to look up sources for the descriptions of Roman soldiers' attire, and especially to figure what each number is pointing to. It wasn't even always clear what the numbers on the template referred to and two of the numbers were missing. In addition, there were a lot of glitches with the grading software. Finally our questions were almost never answered. Otherwise I found this to be an interesting course and I learned quite a bit from it, although it could have been condensed into three or four classes at the very most. The video lectures were videotaped a bit strangely, with Professor Fine often seeming to talk to an invisible person on the right or the left of the camera, instead of at the viewer. The videos I liked were mostly the office hours ones and the one with the interview with Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove at Park Avenue Synagogue. I could have gotten a very good grade on this course, but the last assignment ruined that. No, I will not be recommending this course or any others by this Professor.",2
9822,"Highly recommended for the would-be historian of Rome and ancient Judea. A course which challenges the common viewpoint of both Christians and Jews, with major implications for the reinterpretation of other artifacts surviving from the classical period.",5
9823,"It was a very interesting, insightful and enjoyable course. A lesson of history which I wasn't consider like that before. The passion of Pr. Steven Fine was obvious and strong. Thank you for the opportunity to learn from you.",4
9824,great course,5
9825,The best course i have come across on Coursera,5
9826,Too many generalities and roundabouts and little real detail.,2
9827,"great course, well taught.",5
9828,"This course is badly structured, with proposed tasks not being well oriented, and videos where teachers are constantly doubting and making mistakes. Not really happy with it.",1
9829,Enjoyed working through this course. Well structured and paced.,5
9830,"It's a compulsory course to apply for professional accountancy Msc of UOL. Short, smart course.",5
9831,Excellent contents with lot of learning and enhancing professional exposure,5
9832,So fresh...,5
9833,"A very powerful course, I would definitely recommend any of my colleagues to do, especially, the ACCA holders who like to take the current Masters in Professional Accountancy.",5
9834,Quite interesting and very relevant as a good reminder of the fundamental concepts.,5
9835,Really enjoyed the course.,5
9836,This course is worth learning in order to be uptodate with new things in the business and standards.,5
9837,Good for a general understanding of the mainstream theories relating to business strategy and corporate governance.,4
9838,GOOD AND COMPREHENSIVE,5
9839,Excellent resource for getting up to speed with some of the challenges that the accountancy profession is faced with. I do however feel that this course and the accountancy profession as a whole needs to the consider the repercussions of rapid technological advancement and how these would impact the profession as a whole. The Accountants of tomorrow will need to be able to delegate the mundance daily tasks associated with financial accounting and bookkeeping etc. and be able to think and act more like business people. The course should also look into this aspect.,4
9840,Videos are too short,3
9841,comprehensive yet a bit too easy,4
9842,Top option for learning.,5
9843,"There are serious issues in the IT infrastructure for this Online Course. Coursera needs to upgrade their IT infrastructure for it to be real time. You may go through the threads in Help for more information and issues posted by other users.Apart from this, it is extremely difficult to communicate with someone in Coursera regarding anything and in any form, i.e email, live chat, etc.",1
9844,Very useful course !,5
9845,"Very relevant program and applicable to current economic, social and global iss",5
9846,Great and interesting,4
9847,"Good refresh of managerial knowledge, especially if combined with my practical experience, thx",4
9848,Very Informative,5
9849,Indepth and challenging - brilliant,5
9850,The course is well-developed to cover key issues that are brought about changes in the,4
9851,Awesome course. I would definitely recommend it to any Finance professional wanting to keep abreast with the various changes in the profession.,5
9852,Great course. Well structuredould highly recommend.,5
9853,Very informative,5
9854,best coaching provided by coursera and its also a effective way to study with coursera instead of going through books,5
9855,Already doneThank you,5
9856,it is a very good course to start in android,4
9857,its my first day hope for the best,4
9858,This course is recommend for beginner to learn on how to create their own apps.,5
9859,Excellent course that introduces students to android app development through practical and comprehensive topics. Allowed me to build my first app and launch on Google Play Store.,5
9860,really awesome,5
9861,So helpful and interesting.Thank you Coursera and all the team members who make this course.,5
9862,good course,5
9863,"Nice course, thank you!",4
9864,"I love my course, since I started Ive been learning a lot. Thank you coursera",5
9865,"I really liked the course! Good combination of videos, example apps and quizzes.",5
9866,I enrolled for this course because of pure interest in android app development and didn't think I would complete it with my existing work schedule (happened to me on several earlier courses) BUT this course is made to be feasible for the busy/less motivated/slow (all apply to me). The material is well organized and sufficient for beginners. By the last date of the the course I DID complete all the lessons and assignments. It was a tremendous feeling and the credit goes to the course setup. The exemplar apps seem trivial during introduction of the course and you wonder if they are too simple for a wannabe app developer but as the course progresses its evident why you need to learn developing them. The instructors also explain alternate ways to achieve a result. The quizzes are challenging and drive you to know more on your own. Best 4 weeks spent on coursera.,5
9867,Good course to understand the basics properly and then take it forward from there.,5
9868,"The first courses are great.Unfortunately, the course that covered the installation (week 2 - ""create your first basic application with android studio"") got me lost.",2
9869,The design of the course structure is extremely useful for beginners.,5
9870,"I am very sorry to say that the course is very poor in english (speaking), too bad you do not teach the course in french this could be useful for a lots of french speaking students and better for the quality of the course.",2
9871,Excellent course to get started on android app.,5
9872,Great course but can have some improvments,4
9873,I especially thank you for those great 9 blocks. They are really helpful to start.,5
9874,i need android programming based course specially in xamrin / visual studio ........... i feel so much disappointment .,3
9875,its a great course and i learned a lot during this course process and finally created a basic android app .I thought that there should be a tutorial of shared preferences in this course,4
9876,"The instructor's explanation is not orderly nor structured, and with a lot of 'noises'.",2
9877,Best course to begin android development.,5
9878,Very useful and well designed online course!,5
9879,Great Course :),5
9880,"Very fundamental, if they can talk about some UI design principle, that would be 5 stars.",4
9881,I enjoy this course. But why enghish ?,5
9882,I havent' built an app as of now but am likely to build in few days.,5
9883,"I appreciated the building blocks approach, and the highlight to importance on prototyping in week 1.Some skills in java are required.",5
9884,great course to start with,5
9885,I would recommend this course for the beginners,5
9886,"Really Great, PDF and apps are captured with snapshots and explained in sort and crisp with diagram as compare to just sentences. Good for start up of android app development. Thanks to author and content creator to bring interest on this course. I recommended to all my team members and they also started this course",5
9887,Very informative and beginner friendly. Thanks!,5
9888,Great course,5
9889,"It is most useful,interesting and important course the basics they are given are very good.",4
9890,"Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course) is a well organised course with good introductory material covering basics of the android development. I recommend this course to anyone who is new to Android development or anyone who wants to brush up their android development basics. You'll need to work through out this 5 week course. The course material is consolidated with Quizzes. By the end of the course you will know how to prototype, design and code an android application with the best practices in mind using a rubric. Instructors of this course are good too in terms of knowing their stuff and being able to convey and explain it in simple terms.",5
9891,"Mildly fast,well built and useful.",5
9892,very good course,5
9893,It´s a great course for beginners,5
9894,"Great course. It shows and explains the whole process of application development. From the idea, the sketch to execution. We will learn how to install the development environment, and how the application is running. After the course we are able to create an average of advanced applications with GUI and use ready-made functions of Android. I highly recommend and everything in five weeks (or less) !!",5
9895,This is very helpful course for my project and hopefully for my job in future as well,5
9896,I still do not know how to put the application that I created to my phone or make it available to other phones to download.,4
9897,this course was good for every begginner who has no basic understanding about android.. it help me alot to learn the basic,4
9898,"Took the free version of this course to learn some basic building blocks of Android app dev and to dive back into programming, already having Java knowledge from long ago. For my purposes it was a good intro. For a totally new coder this might not be best as there isn't deep explanation of the code itself. But for the rest, it allows you to quickly dive in.",4
9899,i was very excited at the beginning of the coursebut when i figure out that i must paid for unlock some important lecturei really felt disappointed i thought i should only paid if i want to took the Certificatei had been wasted some time at this coursenow i have to search for another course but complete one this time.,1
9900,Really looking forward to this class. Getting a better understanding of JAVA mixed with creating a mobile app sounds awesome.,5
9901,"I think it's a great tester course with very good Blocks of code, and these blocks of code are not seen until week 4 and 5. Week 3 was a hands on km to miles, and miles to km app, good hands on. I explored the course, so I'd not do any of the exercises, but did the final assignment from what I suggested I will create in week two. I created a great app, but wasn't able to share it, so i'll put it on github.",4
9902,"Poor material, terrible french accent, not a good Android course at all.I don't raccoment it unless you're a total novice at Android development.",1
9903,What a fantastic course.Thanks to the mentors.One can learn the basic designing of an android application from scratch using this course.,5
9904,Good basic course hard to get lost but does require some follow through if things are unfamiliar,4
9905,There are courses that offer better level of details and better course materials and presentation .. and also for free ..However this course is a best-effort course and is helpful for beginners.,3
9906,"Good overall but you should use better microphone, because sometimes it's hard to understand and improve your English.",3
9907,Explanation of concept was poor,2
9908,Very good class. Need to have some knowledge of Java ideally.,4
9909,I very much enjoyed this course. It gave a great introduction to Android programming for those who don't know any android programming to start with. I recommend this course as a place to start.,5
9910,"The course if well-organized and the instructors do a very good job. However, three weeks of slides and theory and then only the last two weeks of seeing code hardly makes the course project-centered in my mind. Also, requiring learners to upgrade to run an autograder on a quiz is ridiculous!",2
9911,Great!,5
9912,"easy learning,understanding..",5
9913,Nicely targeted for the programmer needing a jump start into Android while having a good base in Java.,4
9914,"The free version of the course is far more restricted than other courses I've taken, the content wasn't brilliant, and it wasn't really more advanced than other tutorials with far better presenters which can be found online for free",1
9915,Great learning experience.,5
9916,I thought it was free. I might was well go to Google to learn Android development.,1
9917,"You really need prior coding experience to understand the training. I also was very disappointed in the teaching. We have an incredible opportunity to improve education, and I feel that this course is merely an extension of current learning techniques. It was extremely difficult for me to fully participate without paying. I was using this course to make a specific android app to control my wheelchair. I act as an analyst for my programmer husband. So I fully understand code architecture, but absolutely hate coding by hand. This course glossed over coding however it is far more code intensive then I was led to believe.",1
9918,It is interesting.,4
9919,excellent course to get started in android. helps build basic blocks that can then be used to develop more complex apps as well as know where to search for more info. great job!!!,5
9920,This is real boring I just learned that,1
9921,"Very Good course, simple and deep.",4
9922,Fantastic course,5
9923,"Well organized course. Refined down to details. Gradual introduction of topics, good test-case, the skill of the Professor is excellent.",5
9924,"not exciting, instructor too stiff and looked like reading a paper",1
9925,This could be improved by adding more interesting subjects :- how to use list adapters with list view- how to use menus- how to use scrolling view- etc,3
9926,This is a very good hands-on course to introduce new students to learning Android programming.I have basic knowledge of Java and found this course easy to understand and follow.Suggestion:Change the graded quiz to practice quiz so that non-paying students can submit and check their answers and learn from it. Or find another alternative to Coursera since it is not 100% free for students.I look forward to another building blocks Android course in the future! Thank you for this course!,5
9927,Can't finish even week 1 if you don't pay,1
9928,Very Good Course.,5
9929,"Big 5 star. Unfortunately I can't give more. My suggestions are to re record the section where the male instructor was explaning the very first android app,; the video quality on that section was very poor. My next suggestion will be: you guys mapped that course perfectly, you should add an advance level to this course or at least, create an android specialization for this course. At last, it would be a better idea after all 9 blocs, before the student submitted their project, the instructors create a big app that include some of the bloc or all of the blocs. This course will be my first completed course on coursera and I will definitely going to pay for that one later",5
9930,"Great course for biologists and non biologists. Materials well explained and interesting, stuff very helpful and eager. It opens a window to bioinformatics and is a good first step towards it. Very recommended!",5
9931,"Thank you.This course was very effective for me.It has a lot of details, and I need to review some issues agian",4
9932,"Personally, I never believed I would enjoy coding, but I had a deep interest for biology. This course not only helped me develop an interest and grasp the basics of programming in python but also gave me an insight as to how I can use this knowledge I gained in various fields such as bioinformatics.",5
9933,It's amazing course,5
9934,Excellent course! Instructors are great and the exercises using Stepik are awesome,5
9935,A very entertaining way to learn programming and applying this new acquired knowledge to real problems in biology.,5
9936,"Limited intro course compared to one offered few years ago but still Great start , Thank you",4
9937,Really interactive and challenging. I learned a lot. Thank you.,5
9938,"This has been a very helpful course, showing me how to program in a fun way because every coding challenge is linked to a biological question. I think the pace of the course was good, without any prior experience in coding I've had a few moments where I was stuck. But thankfully with some patience and helpful replies from the teaching assistant of the course to my questions in the discussion, it was possible to get past those coding problems.",4
9939,Step by step method.,5
9940,"Great course. I learned a lot. I came into it with only a little bit of background in Python coding. I worked through the recommended Code Academy modules and attempted the course work early and often. I feel like my understanding of algorithms, molecular biology, and Python coding have all improved in just 4 short weeks. I look forward to learning more Python, algorithms, and molecular biology from UC San Diego and others.",5
9941,Very interesting but i don't like switching e-learning platforms,3
9942,It was a really interesting course! Some exercises were challenging but it was very rewarding when you found the solution.,5
9943,True introduction to Bioinf.It helps a lot.,5
9944,"Really liked the course and love the topic, however the algorithms section was very difficult and could use some more in depth explaining. Without that, I would not quantify it as ""beginner"".",4
9945,Good course for someone beginning in bioinformatics with background on computer programming.,5
9946,"The stepik interactive text was just amazing !! I think it is a great way to teach. Integrating with Code Academy to learn Python was really helpful. I spent quite a bit of time on a few challenges. However, arriving at the solution was very rewarding. As a biologist, it is a good start for first time exposure to bioinformatics and algorithms. There were some concepts I had to read multiple times to understand. Some detailed explanations by earlier students were helpful in a few cases.",4
9947,"It's a great introductory course for Python and Bioinformatics. I found the platform for completing assignments, Stepiks, to be very slick and easy to use. Completing this course was so satisfying, informative and fun!",5
9948,Good introduction to specialization,5
9949,Very good introductory course to new learners in bioinformatics or students who are just curious about this field.,4
9950,The course was amazing!,4
9951,"I really enjoyed this course, thanks to coursera",4
9952,"Challenging and interesting. Only downside is the lack of help in the programming sections. I had been stuck on one of the last code challanges for more than a month without anyone of the staff answering my messages in the comments. Besides that, great course and content.",5
9953,"Very helpful and well designed, thank you !",5
9954,"It uses mixed material from other platforms meant for pure Python programming learning, jumps between sections in the external platform going forward and back so its pretty confusing to find problems involving content that you have no chance to know if you do not have previous experience with python. I would not recommend this course for beginners in programming.",1
9955,"thank you guys,the most difficult lesson I have got,but I love the feelings when I finally accomplish it.",5
9956,"Good class, great for beginners to get started!",5
9957,"I had great fun learning each week of the course. For students interested in understanding DNA, I would sincerely recommend. Also was the best experience I had learning Bioinformatics and python simultaneously. I believe in learning contextually. Thanks",5
9958,"Pros: a lot of programming in automated online environment.Cons: inconsistencies in code like changing parameter order in often used functions, changing structure of some variables (arrays become dicts). This can be unneccesarily misleading.",3
9959,cool,5
9960,very challenging course,4
9961,Really helpful to understand basic bioinformatics.,5
9962,"The course content is highly challenging and that's great for a sense of accomplishment. The biological problems motivates the biologist to go through the abstract mathematical concepts(but I have to admit there is a threshold where the biologist can not get it well anymore(greedy motifs, gibbs ...) and I wonder if he does really need it to be practical with day to day problems with chip array seq selex...)be ready you will struggle hard here",4
9963,"very interesting!, i liked the stepik interactive lesson very much, i prefer them over lectures",4
9964,Thanks for this nice course.I would recommend to avoid exercises with very long calculations that cause time-limit problems.Regards,5
9965,The interactive design in the course makes me impressive,5
9966,"Not a bad course, but it is a python programming class. There are some steeper steps at times if you are not used to python. Support can seem distant if you hit one of these steeper steps. It's best to have a coding attitude and not a ""I want to read about biology and genetics"" attitude to approach this class.",4
9967,"A good introduction to computational aspects of bioinformatics. However, the pace of the course might seem too low if you have a strong computer science background.",4
9968,Nicely designed course. Frustrating at times but well worth the effort.,5
9969,"It's good, but I would prefer that the python was taught within the course.",4
9970,"Very good course, and very similar to the first course of the Bioinformatics Specialization. However be warned, it takes a lot of time and effort to complete this course (definitely more than 10 hours a week).",5
9971,Excellent course for beginner like me!!!Thank again for introducing me to this matter.,5
9972,It really has helped me programming on Python.,5
9973,"Very badly linked with other websites that provide the actual content. This is more like a click-bait setup than the actual course. I'm not sure why it's even offered on Coursera, other than to make money on a more popular website using the content hosted by less popular one. Very bad experience.",1
9974,"An excellent course that is a great opportunity for anyone interested in bioinformatics, no previous experience is necessary but either a biological, mathematical or computing background will give you advantages in certain areas. Being a biologist I struggled at first and many of you may do the same but stick with it, work hard on it and you will be rewarded and it is incredibly satisfying.Due to the practical coding nature of the course, each week can take up a lot of you time. Best if you have a few weeks free (e.g. a graduate student like me) so you can spend a few whole days of it but could be done before/after work if you are motivated and plug away at it each day - just something to keep in mind though, don't expect a light easy 1 hour a week course, it is intensive but in a good way. It can get frustrating, you will want to give up time and time again....but stick at it and you will have a shiny new Coursera certificate and a wealth of programming knowledge under your belt once you finish!A massive two thumbs up for this course, one of the best ones out there that gives you real worthwhile skills that employers and academia want. Thanks to all the course staff for a great experience!",5
9975,Stepic issues with not syncing progress and assignment completion. All else was good. Well paced.,4
9976,Frustrating as hell. Too much math and computer coding.,1
9977,"This is not a beginner's course unless you already have previous programming experience. The Python lessons are just samples taken from a completely different curriculum on Codecademy and poorly integrated into the bio-centric course content. The lessons are disjointed, taken out of context, and some of the examples are using the wrong version of Python and missing parentheses. It would be a lot better if they took the time to actually craft custom Python lessons designed specifically for this course instead of using ill-fitting lessons from other classes.",3
9978,"I give this course 5 star because I did Bioinformatics I and I totally enjoy it.This is where programming can be fun, and practical, and you'll learn some basic biology too.What's not to love?",5
9979,Innovations and creativity have been immersed into my mind through learning the course.,4
9980,Loved this course. Lots of great info and fascinating ideas. A must for anyone interested in astrobiology!,5
9981,Good course.,5
9982,A really nice course for someone pursuing astronomy or likes to know more about the cosmos. Really expands one's knowledge of the universe.,5
9983,"Again a course that comes with very simple (and not always good prepared) video lectures but for recieving a grade an enormous math knowledge is necessary, with no further help given",1
9984,Really enjoyed this course which gives a good summary about astronomy to beginners like me.,5
9985,So far a very easy to understand and enjoyable course. As someone coming from High school with some research and knowledge in Astronomy this was a great way to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and get a more technical sense of Astronomy. The prof makes this incredibly enjoyable. Lectures are paced well and the 'homework'/practice work is easy enough.,5
9986,"If you know nothing about astronomy, this is a great starting point. You will cover a brief overview of everything from the solar system to the frontiers of dark matter and dark energy. It will allow you to get a taste of everything so that when you're ready, you can dive in deeper to the topics that interest you the most.",5
9987,This course is the worst i have taken on coursera. They just want to mention everything in very short time. Quiz is much harder than material on video.,3
9988,"Really great course, but I would recommend that if you haven't taken many classes in this branch of the sciences to take a different introductory course, first. It can still be done, but might require more study and review of additional resources.",5
9989,"a great introduction to a complex field, highly recommended.",5
9990,Great Course! Very interesting!,5
9991,Great course! Loved Adams' enthusiasm in sharing his knowledge with the virtual audience. Comprehensive and very spot on. Congratulations.,5
9992,Great teacher! Extremely interesting lessons. The teacher was able to explain very complicated aspects in physics to non specialists audience in an intriguing manner. Thank you!,5
9993,"The best course I've seen on Coursera! Wonderful lectures, amazing pictures and animations and all very engaging.",5
9994,Enjoyed it very much,4
9995,"great content and great teacher, thanks so much for this :)",5
9996,Great course to learn the wonders of the universe by understanding a littler of how it works! Saludos desde Venezuela!,5
9997,"Very exciting, strong structured course, The most difficult materials in a simplified and exciting declamation. Great lecturer .",5
9998,Easy to follow. Anyone who is interested in Astronomy should take this course. This course is better than the course (Astronomy - Big Questions) that I took at my University.,5
